### _"... Before attacking what appeared to be a new icing problem we should study the icing work of the 1940's and 50's."_ [^1]

Two investigators operate a large mechanical computer. 
One is seated turning a crank attached to a large cylinder labeled "Input Chart". 
The second operator turns another input chart crank. 
Another cylinder is labeled "Droplet Trajectories". 
There are many shafts and gears visible in the machine. 
Some machine parts are labeled with the differential equations of motion being solved.

## Summary  

I have made this blog up as I went along. 
I have a general plan to cover all 132 icing publications in the 
["Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md), 
but I also find other interesting, related items along the way.  

Future topic possibilities include:  

- Water drop impingement (there are 20 publications in the ["Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md) 
that I have not yet gotten to).  
- The University of Michigan 1953 Airplane Icing Information Course. 
A "Greatest Thing That You (Probably) Have Never Read" candidate.  

  - Accomplished! [Thread: The University of Michigan Airplane Icing Information Course, 1953]({filename}U%20of%20Michigan%20Icing.md)  
 
- NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention A Compilation of Papers Presented by NACA Staff Members. 6505/NACA-1947/8, 1947.  
This is available at [DTIC](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA800876).  
- [Project Cirrus, Final Report, 1948](https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/weather/CirrusFinal.pdf). Weather control, anyone?  
- Mazin, I. P., 1957: The Physical Principles of Aircraft Icing (in Russian). Gidrometeoizdat, 120 pp.  
A translation to English is available at [DTIC](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA083374.pdf)  
- Let's build YA2DISCuP (Yet Another 2D Ice Shape Calculation Program)  

If you particularly like one of those, or have a suggestion of your own, 
please contact me (contact options shown below under "social").
