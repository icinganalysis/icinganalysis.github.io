_From NACA-TN-2904_  

I have made this blog up as I went along. 
I have a general plan to cover all 132 icing publications in the 
["Selected Bibilography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md), 
but I also find other interesting, related items along the way.  

Future topic possibilities include:  

- Water drop impingement (there are 20 publications in the ["Selected Bibilography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md) 
that I have not yet gotten to).  
- The University of Michigan 1953 Airplane Icing Information Course. 
A "Greatest Thing That You (Probably) Have Never Read" candidate.      
- NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention A Compilation of Papers Presented by NACA Staff Members. 6505/NACA-1947/8, 1947.  
This is available at [DTIC](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA800876).  
- [Project Cirrus, Final Report, 1948](https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/weather/CirrusFinal.pdf). Weather control, anyone?  
- Mazin, I. P., 1957: The Physical Principles of Aircraft Icing (in Russian). Gidrometeoizdat, 120 pp.  
A translation to English is available at [DTIC](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA083374.pdf)  
- Let's build YA2DISCuP (Yet Another 2D Ice Shape Calculation Program)
