## Summary  

While icing weather is a serious topic for aircraft, 
several sources have used [debatably] humorous,
instructive illustrations of the hazards.   

## Discussion  

### Aviation Weather For Pilots and Flight Operations Personnel. AC 00-6A (Cancelled) [^1]  

![Chapter 10 Icing. 
A pilot sits in or on a small cartoon airplane, 
much of which is encased in a block or ice.

### "Mechanical De-Icing Systems" [^2]  

![A cartoon drawing of an airplane in flight, 
with pilots visible in the flight deck windows. 
There is snow on the ground below. 
Mechanical arms are coming out from hatches on the airplane, 
removing ice from the wing leading edge with ice picks.

### Air Command Weather Manual (Canada) [^3]  

![Chapter 9 Aircraft Icing. 
A pilot sitting in or on a small cartoon airplane pushes up against 
the lid of a box of ice around the airplane. 
The caption reads: 
"Aircraft accidents generally occur after a series of events place a pilot in a
box from which be [he?] cannot escape. Icing is one of the events that can close
the box, making an accident inevitable. Your knowledge of icing and how it
affects your aircraft may prevent the last side of the box from closing."](images%2FAir%20Command%20Weather%20Manual%2FChapter%209%20AIrcraft%20Icing.png)

with stylized human forces of reduced thrust pushing aft, 
increased drag pulling aft, 
decreased lift pushing down, and increased weight pulling down.](images/Force_Icing.png)
