# "Investigation of Porous Gas-Heated Leading-Edge Section for Icing Protection of a Delta Wing" [^1]  

## Abstract  

>SUMMARY
> 
> A tip section of a delta wing having an NACA 0004-65 airfoil section 
and a 60째 leading-edge sweepback was equipped with a porous leading-edge 
section through which hot gas was bled for anti-icing. Heating
rates for anti-icing were determined for a wide range of icing conditions. 
The effects of gas flow through the porous leading-edge section
on airfoil pressure distribution and drag in dry air were investigated.
The drag increase caused by an ice formation on the unheated airfoil was
measured for several icing conditions. Experimental porous surface- to
free-stream convective heat-transfer coefficients were obtained in dry
air and compared with theory.
> 
> Adequate icing protection was obtained at all icing conditions investigated. 
Savings in total gas-flow rate up to 42 percent may be obtained 
with no loss in anti-icing effectiveness by sealing half tne
upper-surface porous area. Gas flow through the leading-edge section
had no appreciable effect on airfoil pressure distribution. The airfoil 
section drag increased slightly (5-percent average) with gas flow
through the porous surface. A heavy glaze-ice formation produced after
10 minutes of icing caused an increase in section drag coefficient of
240 percent. Experimental convective heat-transfer coefficients obtained
with hot-gas flow through the porous area in dry air and turbulent flow
were 20 to 30 percent lower than the theoretical values for a solid surface 
under similar conditions. The transition region from laminar to
turbulent flow moved forward as the ratio of gas velocity through the
porous surface to air-stream velocity was increased.  

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION
> 
> An airfoil may be protected in icing conditions by heating the
leading-edge section so that all impinging water is evaporated. The
required heat is usually obtained either by use of electric heating
blankets or hot gas flowing through chordwise passages in contact with 
the inner surface of the wing skin. Increasing speeds of present-day
aircraft have resulted in very large heating rates for this method of
protection (ref. 1), requiring either large generating capacity for an
electric system or high gas-flow rates for a gas-heated system. One
means of reducing these heating requirements is by the use of a cyclic
de-icing system. Research on such systems (refs. 2 and 3) has shown a
reduction in heat requirement over continuous heating systems. For a
high-speed thin-wing aircraft, considerations of available space,
weight, complexity, and limited time in icing may require the use of a
continuous heating system in spite of the higher heating requirements.
The required surface heat release may be achieved in an economical manner 
by using a porous-metal leading-edge section through which hot gas
is bled. Since the porous metal provides a large hot-gas contact area,
the temperature of the porous surface is the same as that of the gas
leaving the wing. With a conventional system having chordwise channels,
the temperature of the gas leaving the channels is higher than the outer-skin 
temperature, and heat is wasted. Where space is limited, the .porous
surface has the additional advantage of attaining a high heat-release
rate in a relatively short heated length.  
> 
> The use of a porous-skin heating system, however, may have effects
on airfoil lift and drag. These effects may be measured experimentally
to determine whether or not they are important. Contamination of the
porous area by dust and insects may also be a problem. Periodic cleaning 
of the porous surfaces may be an acceptable solution.  
> 
> Some experimental data on the use of a porous wall for heating
are available. An experimental and theoretical investigation using
a porous flat plate is reported in reference 4. A comparison between
a porous-skin heating system for icing protection and a double-skin
system with chordwise channels was made in reference 5 for one icing
condition and indicates that the porous system is the more efficient
of the two.  
> 
> The associated field of transpiration cooling, wherein air is used
to cool a porous wall in contact with a hot gas, has received much
greater attention, both experimentally and theoretically (refs. 6 to 10).
The superiority of transpiration cooling over convection cooling is shown
in reference 8. Heat-transfer coefficients for laminar and turbulent
flow may be obtained from the transpiration-cooling literature and applied 
to the problem of porous-wall heating provided the surface to free-stream 
temperature difference is small. The transition region from laminar 
to turbulent flow usually must be located experimentally for a particular 
body.    
> 
> The present investigation was conducted in the NACA Lewis icing
research tunnel using an airfoil model provided by an aircraft manufacturer. 
The influence of the porous system on airfoil pressure distribution, 
drag, and heat transfer was determined in dry air. Drag of the
airfoil in icing with no heat was investigated to establish the need for
icing protection. Heating requirements of the porous system for anti-icing 
were determined, and system performance was observed for a wide
range of icing conditions. The de-icing characteristics of the porous
leading-edge system were investigated briefly.

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
> 
> The results of an investigation of a porous gas-heated leading-edge
section for icing protection of a delta wing may be summarized as
follows:  
>1. Satisfactory anti-icing protection was obtained at all conditions
investigated. A gas-flow rate of 143 pounds per hour per foot span with
an entrance gas temperature of 496째 F was sufficient for protection at
the following condition: airspeed, 275 miles per hour; 
datum air temperature, 0째 F; angle of attack, 2째; and liquid-water content, 0.4 gram
per cubic meter.  
>2. Ice formation on the unheated leading edge, which may occur prior
to activation of the heating system, was removed in 1 to 1 1/2 minutes by a
hot-gas-flow rate that would be sufficient for normal anti-icing.  
>3. A full-span insulated hot-gas delivery tube should be provided to
minimize the spanwise gas-temperature loss.  
>4. For positive angles of attack, a saving in total gas-flow-rate
for anti-icing of 31 to 42 percent may be obtained with no loss in anti-icing 
effectiveness by sealing half the upper-surface porous area.  
>5. Gas flow through the porous leading-edge section had no appreciable 
effect on airfoil pressure distribution. Sealing the porous area
did not affect the airfoil pressure distribution.  
>6. Gas flow through the porous area sufficient to provide icing
protection caused a slight increase in airfoil drag (5-percent average)
in most cases. Sealing the porous area did not change the airfoil drag.
>7. The section drag coefficient of the unheated airfoil increased
from 0.0066 to 0.0106 (60 percent) in 10 minutes of icing at moderate
liquid-water content. A heavy glaze-ice formation, formed at a high
liquid-water content, caused an increase in section drag coefficient
from 0.0065 to 0.0222 (240 percent) in 10 minutes.  
>8. The extent of laminar flow in dry air with gas flow was small;
most of the heated area was in the transition region from laminar to
turbulent flow. The transition region moved forward as the ratio of gas
velocity through the porous surface to free-stream velocity increased.
>9. Experimental convective heat-transfer coefficients in dry air
and turbulent flow were approximately 20 to 30 percent lower than the
theoretical values for a solid surface, while the theories of Friedman
and Mickley predict for the same conditions a reduction of 10 to 15 and
20 to 25 percent, respectively.  

Another "associated field" of the use of flow through a porous surface 
is laminar flow control. 
Air is drawn in through the porous surface to reduce the growth of the boundary layer, 
thus promoting laminar flow further along a surface than would happen otherwise, 
reducing drag. 

As for ice protection, "Contamination of the
porous area by dust and insects may also be a problem".  

Providing ice protection for an airfoil with a porous surface could be done using heated air 
blown out through the surface, as in NACA-RM-E54I03. 
The use of [Freezing Point Depressant Fluids]({filename}Freezing%20point%20depressant.md) 
has also been proposed.

I view this as under-appreciated, as the technology has had recent interest for 
providing ice protection to areas with laminar flow control.  

This appears to be the first test of this ice protection technology.
