Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

- Interesting finds:

Werner, J. B., Ice Protection Investigation for Advanced Rotary-Wing Aircraft. 1973. https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0771182.pdf
This is a candidate for "The Greatest Thing That You Have (Probably) Never Read".
It is providing much material for the upcoming "Conclusions of the Impingement on Surfaces Thread".

- Most popular posts (so far...):

#1: A Gentle Introduction to Aircraft Icing https://icinganalysis.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-aircraft-icing.html
I would like to say that it was my concise, instructional prose that made this popular,
but really it was probably the sensational quote (thanks, Thomas S.!) and things went viral (by my modest standards).

- Upcoming re-posts:

The relentless reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).

- Quote of the week

"The brief instructions accompanying the set of graphs in Appendix C are noncommittal in describing how these curves are to be applied."
From DOT/FAA/AR-07/4, "Advances in the Characterization of Supercooled Clouds for Aircraft Icing Applications",
discussing the Appendix C icing requirements.

I might subtitle this one "We may have over-done it!".
I would also describe this as atypical, or completely non-representative, of in-flight icing.
I heard a third-hand rumor that the investigators knew this was not a very representative over-all condition,
but they were interested in ice on one component fairly far aft, and this was the result.
