Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

- Latest post:

A Tentative Identification of Water Drop Trajectory Investigators https://icinganalysis.com/a-tentative-identification-of-water-drop-trajectory-investigators.html

- Other popular posts (so far...):

We have been through #6 to #1, so I will note other popular posts.

The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications https://icinganalysis.com/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html
The other on-line sources are pdfs, which when scanned produce errors.
I made this available on-line as searchable text, with several corrections made by hand.

- Upcoming re-posts:

The relentless reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).

11/13: NACA-ARR-5G13, "Kinetic Temperature of Wet Surfaces A Method of Calculating the Amount of Alcohol Required to Prevent Ice, and the Derivation of the Psychrometric Equation"

- Upcoming Aircraft Icing Events:

Submissions for papers close December 13 for the AIAA Aviation Forum, July 29 to August 2, 2024, so get typing!

- Quote of the week

"This paper summarizes some of the techniques used in NACA programs to solve aircraft icing problems and indicate
the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing protection systems."

Uwe Von Glahn, "THE ICING PROBLEM - CURRENT STATUS of NACA TECHNIQUES AND RESEARCH", 1955.
Reprinted in NASA-TM-81651 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19820003180

After authoring many of the NACA publications on icing,
Uwe von Glahn went on to NASA to become the Jet Acoustics Branch chief engineer.
There are some photos of people in the NACA icing publications, none of them identified,
and I have not found one that appears to be von Glahn.

- A pause in publishing

The newsletter and new posts will pause, probably until January 2024.
Reposting of revised posts will continue on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis
as it is automated.
You do not need an account on mastodon to see them, just follow the link.
