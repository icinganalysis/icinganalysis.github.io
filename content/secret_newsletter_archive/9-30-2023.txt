Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

- Interesting finds:

A commenter on LinkedIn pointed me to Kelley Johnson's 1940 "Wing Loading, Icing and Associated Aspects of Modern Transport Design" https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.10478. I might add this to the Ice Shapes and Their Effects thread on the blog.

- Most popular posts (so far...):

#6: NACA-TN-313, "The Formation of Ice upon Airplanes in Flight" https://icinganalysis.com/naca-tn-313.html
One of the earliest publications I have reviewed, with eye-catching sketches and a great quote.

- Quote of the week:

“the greatest of all our problems is ice.”

'The situation changed in the mid-1920s when the intrepid aviators of the U.S. Air Mail Service attempted to maintain scheduled day-and-night operations between New York and Chicago... As one of their pilots noted at the time about the hazards of the New York-Chicago route, “the greatest of all our problems is ice.”'

#AltText: Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904. Water-drop-trajectory analog.
Two investigators operate a large mechanical computer.
One is seated turning a crank attached to a large cylinder labeled "Input Chart".
The second operator turns another input chart crank.
Another cylinder is labeled "Droplet Trajectories".
There are many shafts and gears visible in the machine.
Some machine parts are labeled with the differential equations of motion being solved.
