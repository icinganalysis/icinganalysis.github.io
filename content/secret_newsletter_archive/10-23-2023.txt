#3: "Super-Cooled Water Droplets in Rising Currents of Cold Saturated Air" https://icinganalysis.com/super-cooled-water-droplets-in-rising-currents-of-cold-saturated-air.html
"It is possible to develop this theory to cover also growth of water droplets during the adiabatic expansion of a rising mass of saturated air."

- Upcoming re-posts:

The relentless reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.socia/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).
10/23: "A Langmuir B drop size distribution is (almost) a normal distribution"
10/25: NACA-TN-2904 "Impingement of Water Droplets on a Cylinder in an Incompressible Flow Field and Evaluation of Rotating Multicylinder Method for Measurement of Droplet-Size Distribution, Volume-Median Droplet Size, and Liquid-Water Content in Clouds"
10/27: NACA-TN-2903 "Impingement of Cloud Droplets on Aerodynamic Bodies as Affected by Compressibility of Air Flow Around the Body"
