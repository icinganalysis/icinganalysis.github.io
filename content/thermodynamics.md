#Icing Thermodynamics Thread 

This thread will focus on the use of thermodynamic heat and mass balance for icing and ice protection calculations. 

There may be some overlap with ice protection systems, 
but the systems will not be detailed herein.

> Psychrometric equations are presented to calculate the thermal effects of 
evaporation from wet surfaces.
