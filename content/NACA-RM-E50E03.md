## Abstract  

>SUMMARY  
> 
>The results of an investigation of several internal water-inertia-separation 
inlets consisting of a main duct and an alternate duct designed to 
prevent automatically the entrance of large
quantities of water into a turbojet engine in icing conditions are
presented. Total-pressure losses and icing characteristics for a
direct-ram inlet and the inertia-separation inlets are compared at
similar aerodynamic and simulated icing conditions.  
> 
>Complete ice protection for inlet guide vanes could not be
achieved with the inertia-separation inlets investigated. Approximately 
8 percent of the volume of water entering the nacelles
remained. in the air passing into the compressor inlet. Heavy
alternate-duct-elbow ice formations caused by secondary inertia
separation resulted in rapid total-pressure losses and decreases
in mass flow. The duration in an icing condition for an inertia-separation
inlet, without local surface heating, was increased
approximately four times above that for a direct-ram inlet with a
compressor-inlet screen. For normal nonicing operation, the inertia-separation-inlet 
total-pressure losses were comparable to a direct-ram installation. 
The pressure losses and the circumferential uniformity of the mass flow 
in all the inlets were relatively independent 
of angle of attack. Use of an inertia-separation inlet
would in most cases require a larger diameter nacelle than a direct-ram 
inlet in order to obtain an alternate duct sufficiently large
to pass the required engine air flow at duct Mach numbers below
1.0 at the minimum area.

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION
Turbojet-engine ice protection by means of an inlet designed
to separate the free liquid water from the intake air by waterNACA RM E50E03
inertia separation is shown to have possibilities in reference 1.
All the inlets investigated consisted of a single-inlet nacelle
(fig. 1) followed by a main duct for nonicing operation and an
alternate duct with sharply curved passages through which air,
with a reduced water content, passed to the compressor unit during
an icing condition. The results obtained in the investigations of
reference 1 showed that complete water separation could be obtained
only at the expense of considerable total-pressure losses when the
air passed through the alternate duct. The water-separation effectiveness 
of inertia-separation inlets is shown in reference 1 to
be a function of alternate-duct-inlet gap (fig. 1), radial offset
of the duct-splitter ring with respect to the nacelle inlet, curvature 
of the alternate-duct surfaces, and air velocity through the
duct. Design charts in reference 1 indicate that small inlet gaps
are required to prevent small cloud droplets from entering the
alternate duct. A small inlet gap, however, limits the mass flow
through the alternate duct and produces high duct-air velocities
that cause large pressure losses.  

![Figure 1. Typical internal water-inertia-separation inlet showing principal components.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%201.png)  

>Several improved designs, based on the investigation of reference 1, 
were developed at the NACA Lewis laboratory; these designs
were intended to operate in nonicing conditions at pressure-loss
values comparable to direct-ram inlets and to give adequate ice
protection with satisfactory pressure recovery through the alter-nate 
duct in an icing condition.  
> 
>The four water-inertia-separation inlets evaluated herein
were designed with the aid of a simplified analysis and the design
charts presented in reference 1, whereas the inlets previously
investigated were designed by a systematic variation of the configuration 
components prior to the development of design charts.
Aerodynamic and icing studies of these four water-inertia-separation
inlets reported herein were conducted in the NACA 6- by 9-foot
icing-research tunnel. The data were analyzed to obtain pressure-loss 
values at similar mass air flows and to compare the icing tolerance 
that can be obtained with inertia-separation inlets with
that obtained with a conventional direct-ram inlet.

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
> 
>Aerodynamic Results
>
>The pressure loss at various rake stations was calculated as
P0-P, where the total pressure P was obtained at the required
instrumented station. The integrated average total-pressure loss
of all the compressor-inlet-station rakes was chosen as the configuration 
pressure-recovery value. The results presented were not
corrected for tunnelwall interference and blocking effects. The
total-pressure loss of the direct-ram inlet is used as a basis for
comparison with the inertia-separation configurations investigated. 
The pressure loss of the various configurations is presented in 
terms of the mass flow per unit area measured at the
compressor inlet. The effect of varying the angle of attack of
the model from 0° to 6° on total-pressure loss, circumferential
mass-flow variations, and velocity profiles at the compressor inlet
were negligible for all inlets investigated; therefore all aerodynamic 
data are presented for an angle of attack of 0°.  
> 
>Main-duct pressure losses. - in general, for normal nonicing
operation, compressor air passed through only the main duct and
the total-pressure loss for the configurations was a function of
the nacelle-inlet area, the mass flow, and the area diffusion 
characteristics of the inlets. Only for very low mass flows did the
air pass through the main and alternate ducts simultaneously for a
nonicing condition; however, any effect due to flow in both ducts
on the losses was negligible. The pressure loss in figure 4 is
presented in terms of (P0-P2)/p0 . As shown in figure 4, the
Inlets having a large nacelle-inlet area (configurations C, D,
and E) 1ad a considerably lower pressure loss than the smaller
nacelle-inlet-area configuration B because of the difference in
dynamic pressure for similar mass flows. On a comparative basis,
configurations C and D approach the pressure-loss values experienced 
with the direct-ram inlet (configuration A). Small changes
in area at the-alternate-duct inlet did not appreciably affect
the main-duct pressure-loss values, as shown by a comparison of
configurations C and D. The decrease in pressure-loss values for
configuration E, as compared with values for configuration B, can
be mainly attributed to the decreased dynamic pressure in the
nacelle inlet, which resulted in lower expansion losses at the
alternate-duct inlet. in addition, the improved design of the
expansion section downstream of the duct-splitter ring (fig. 3)
also contributed to a reduction in pressure losses.

>From an analysis of the static-pressure measurements obtained
in the region between the duct-splitter ring and the accessory
housing, it was concluded that the flow separation off the duct-splitter 
ring occurred at the alternate-duct inlet, especially for
configuration B. The smaller degree of flow separation for configurations 
C and D were due to the lower duct-velocity pressure
for a given mass flow and to an improved fairing-of the duct-splitter-ring 
leading edge. Configuration E showed a high degree
of flow separation, similar to configuration B, primarily because
the same duct-splitter ring was used. On the basis of the results
obtained in these investigations, it appears feasible to expect a
decrease in the pressure losses for configuration E by refairing
the inner side of the duct-splitter ring so that a contour and area
ratio similar to configurations C and D are obtained.  
> 
>Alternate-duct pressure losses. - Pressure measurements made
in the alternate duct with the main duct blocked by a closure plate
to simulate complete blockage of the screen by ice (fig. 5) showed
that, for low mass flows through the alternate duct, only a small
loss in total-pressure ratio PO-Pa/PO was experienced. At higher
mass flows and as the choked air-flow condition for the ducts was
approached, the pressure loss increased rapidly.  

![Figure 5. Variation of total-pressure loss in alternate
duct with mass flow per unit air-flow area at compressor
inlet. Main duct blocked; airspeed, 250 miles per hour;
angle of attack, 0°.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%205.png)  

>An analysis of the maximum mass flow passing through the various 
configurations indicates that configuration B operated at a
mass flow greater than that produced by sonic velocity at the
design minimum area. This condition could not exist, however,
because the pressure differences available across the model were
insufficient to induce sonic flow. it therefore is evident that
the experimental alternate-duct-inlet gaps and areas may have
varied from the design areas and gaps...

The above illustrates a some-times underappreciated aspect of testing. 
I have seen several test articles where as-built dimensions do not 
exactly match as-designed dimensions. 
Geometry may also distort during tests due to several factors, 
including loads due to installation, thermal loads, and 
aerodynamic loads. 

If your test objects depend upon maintaining tight dimensional tolerances, 
you need to verify the geometry both pre-test and during test 
(with loads applied).  

>Icing Characteristics
> 
>The icing characteristics for the configurations investigated
were similar, differing only as to extent and local quantity of
Ice on the various engine components. Because of this similarity
of icing characteristics, generalized descriptions of component
icing are presented with minor differences pointed out as required.
The icing photographs presented herein are typical for all inlets
except where stated. The solid lines of the sketches included
with some of the photographs indicate the configuration components
that are seen in the icing photograph.  
> 
>Typical ice formations on the nacelle-inlet lips and accessory
housing, as shown in figures 11(a) and 11(c), were, very similar to
those encountered in natural icing conditions (reference 6). The
icing of the nacelle-inlet walls was dependent on the inlet-velocity 
ratios. in all cases, wall ice formations were observed
at low mass-flow values that corresponded to low inlet-velocity
ratios (fig. 11(b)), whereas for high mass-flow values or high
inlet-velocity ratios no such wall ice formations were observed
(fig. 11(c)).  

![Figure 11. Typical ice formations on nacelle-inlet lips, nacelle-inlet walls, and
accessory housing for configuration E.

content, 0.6 gram per cubic meter.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%2011.png)  

>The effect of icing on the remainder of the nacelle components
will be discussed in detail because the manner in which they
tended to ice indicated the effectiveness of the inertia-separation
inlets.

>Screen icing. - in general, the icing of the round-wire screen
was similar for all configurations (fig. 12(a)). M the round
wires began to ice, the ice formations were parallel to the air
stream; however, as the effective frontal area was reduced by the
ice, the air curved around these formations and passed through the
staggered rows of wires, in turn causing the ice formations to
curve toward the accessory housing. Total pressure and aerodynamic
forces on the ice formation sometimes became too great and the ice
ridges broke off and were passed through or lodged against the
screen, causing rapid and severe momentary mass-flow and total-pressure 
fluctuations. This rupture of the ice ridges occurred
with both rime and glaze ice.  
> 
>When the streamlined-wire screen with the greater wire spacing 
was used, the curving of the ice formations as a result of the
stagger of the screen wires was even more evident. The greater
collection efficiency of the streamlined wires caused a more rapid
buildup of ice than the round. wires. A mushrooming tendency of
the ice formations on the streamlined-wire screen is shown in
figure 12(b).  

![Figure 12. Typical ice formations on main-duct screen. Airspeed, 250 miles per hour;
liquid-water content, 0.8 grain per cubic meter; temperature, 10° F.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%2012.png)  

>Duct-splitter ring. - The ice formations on the leading edge
of the duct-splitter rings (fig. 13) for the configurations
investigated extended into the alternate duct to a point at which
the surface of the ring was tangent to the leading-edge radius of
the ring. For cases when the ice formations on the leading edge
also extended into the main duct, the ice tended to project forward 
into the air stream along the portions that were protruding
into the main duct and in time might have blocked the alternate-duct inlet.  

![Figure 13. Typical ice formations on duct-splitter ring of inertia-separation inlets.

unit area, 23.7 pounds per second per square foot.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%2013.png)  

>Alternate duct. - The ice formations in the alternate-duct
elbow were caused by secondary inertia separation in the turn from
the alternate-duct inlet to the alternate duct formed by the duct-splitter 
ring and the nacelle wall. Because of this effective
secondary separation, however, the ridges of ice in the alternate-duct 
elbow built up very rapidly and choked the elbow to such an
extent that the mass flow and total-pressure losses were severely
affected.  
> 
>Front and rear views of a typical ice ridge in the elbow of
configuration E are shown in figures 14(a) and 14(b), respectively.
These ice ridges occurred approximately halfway through the elbow
and protruded into the air stream, thereby reducing the effective
duct area. At times, the ridges were very thin and broke off
unevenly during an icing period, which caused severe fluctuations
and shifts in mass flow and total-pressure losses.  

![Figure 14. Typical ice formation in alternate-duct elbow for configuration E.

>Because secondary inertia separation occurs in the alternate-duct elbow, 
a considerable amount of the remaining water in the
incoming air is concentrated near the alternate-duct nacelle wall,
as shown by the ice formation on the 0.062-inch-diameter ice-indicating 
rod in figure 15. The profile of the ice formation
shown in figure 15 was turned approximately 90° to the air flow
to facilitate photographing the ice formations.

indicator rod in alternate duct for configuration E. Airspeed, 250 miles per hour;

>Bearing struts. - Comparative photographs of bearing-strut
icing for a direct-ram inlet (no screen) and water-inertia-separation
inlets are shown in figure 16. Bearing-strut icing is a minor factor
with water-inertia-separation inlets (fig. 16(b)), whereas with a
direct-ram inlet extremely severe icing occurs (fig. 16(a)). The
heavy deposits of ice near the nacelle walls of the struts for the
direct-ram inlet were caused by the deflection characteristics of the
accessory housing and the ice formations on the nose of this housing.  

![Figure 16. Comparison of ice formations on bearing struts for direct-ram inlet and
typical inertia-separation inlet. Airspeed, 250 miles per hour; liquid-water con-
tent, 0.6 gram per cubic meter; temperature, 10° F.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%2016.png)

>Inlet guide vanes. - With the direct-ram inlet (no screen),
extremely severe ice formations on the indicator blades were
observed (fig. 17(a)). The straight blades had as much as 2 inches
of ice on the leading edge with a maximum frontal thickness of
almost 1 inch during an icing period of 15 minutes.  
Straight-indicator-blade icing characteristics are shown in
figure 17(b) for a typical inertia-separation inlet. The greatest
amount of ice with any configuration was approximately 0.25 inch
for an icing period of 20 minutes. For most inlets, the over-all
separation effectiveness was substantially similar and the differences
in separation qualities were of a local nature. An examination 
of the magnitude of ice formations collected on the straight
flat blades for configuration A (with no screen, fig. 17(a)) and
configuration E (fig. 17(b)) shows that the water collection in
the form of ice for the configuration P blade is approximately
8 percent of that for the direct-ram inlet. This quantity of
water collection is in close agreement with calculated water-
volume-intake percentage (8.4 percent) previously discussed.

![Figure 17. Comparison of flat-inlet-guide-vane icing characteristics for direct-ram
inlet and typical Inertia-separation inlet. Airspeed, 250 miles per hour; liquid-
water content, 0.6 gram per cubic meter; temperature, 10° F.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50E03%2FFigure%2017.png)  

>The curved blade for configuration A (fig. 18(a)) was subjected 
to the same icing condition as the flat blade in figure 17(a).  
The concave side of the curved blade was heavily iced and, based
on the conventional close spacing for this size blade in an engine,
the inlet guide vanes would have been completely blocked except
near the accessory-housing surface.

rem Inlet and typical inertia-separation inlets. Airspeed, 250 miles per hour;

>Typical curved-indicator-blade icing for inertia-separation
inlets is shown in figure 18(b). Under no conditions were large
deposits of ice observed on the curved blade when the inertia-separation 
inlets were used for icing periods up to 20 minutes,
and furthermore, no noticeable mushrooming of the ice occurred at
the leading edge.

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
> 
>From an investigation of the aerodynamic and icing characteristics 
of several water-inertia-separation inlets of a turbojet
engine, the following results were obtained;  
>1. Complete icing protection for inlet guide vanes of a turbojet 
engine could not be achieved, as evidenced by ice formations
on an ice-indicator rod in the alternate duct and on ice-indicator
blades at the compressor inlet.  
Comparative icing rates on ice-indicator blades for a direct-ram 
inlet and inertia-separation inlets showed that approximately
8 percent of the volume of water available at the nacelle inlet
was not separated out of the air stream by the inertia-separation
inlets investigated.  
>2. in a nonicing condition, the total-pressure losses of the
inertia-separation inlets designed to have low dynamic pressures
in the main duct approached that of a conventional direct-ram
inlet.
>3. Total-pressure-loss values for the alternate-duct system
were considerably higher than for a direct-ram inlet. it was
determined that the pressure losses for the alternate-duct system
were a function of duct Mach number and duct-diffuser characteristics. 
Severe pressure losses occurred when the duct Mach number
exceeded values in the range of 0.5 to 0.6.  
>4. No significant effects on total-pressure losses, velocity
profiles at the compressor inlet, or circumferential mass-flow
shifts for the inlets investigated were observed for angles of
attack up to 6.  
>5. Secondary water inertia separation in the alternate duct
caused heavy duct-elbow icing and resulted in a decreasing mass
flow and rapid total-pressure losses, although the use of inertia-separation 
inlets increased the time required to reach a particular
loss in pressure or mass flow by a factor of approximately 4 compared 
with the time required by the direct-rain inlet with compressor-inlet 
screen under the same conditions.  
>6. A mass-flow analysis of all configurations showed that
only the configuration with the largest alternate-duct inlet gap
(1.9 in.) could pass a mass flow through the alternate duct that
is required by current engines. This air flow, however, could
only be passed through the duct at the choking Mach number with
attendant high total-pressure losses. Large mass flows at Mach
numbers below 1.0 at the minimum area in the alternate duct,
resulting in lower total-pressure losses, may be obtained by
increasing the diameter of the nacelle in order to obtain a larger
alternate-duct area.
