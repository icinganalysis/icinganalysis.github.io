Several instruments were developed and improved during the NACA-era 
to measure icing conditions. 

Numerous modes of physics were explored, 
and distant descendants of some of the devices are still used today. 

See also [Icing on cylinders]({filename}Icing on Cylinders.md), and 
[Calibration of the NACA Icing Wind Tunnels]({filename}calibration_of_naca_icing_tunnels.md).
