## Introduction  

There was limited data for properties of liquid water below the temperature of 0° C (supercooled water) at the start of the NACA-era. 
The five studies reviewed here sought to improve the data available.  

The authors were well-informed of other studies available at the time. 
New instruments were conceived and built for these studies. 

These five studies largely considered water drops, 
although much of the data are also applicable to more general aircraft icing analysis.  

Four of the studies concern the temperature at which supercooled water drops will 
spontaneously freeze (freeze without outside influence other than temperature).  

Several of the studies note similarities of the properties of supercooled water and ice. 

These five publications reviewed here are from the seven publications listed in the "Fundamental Properties of Water" section of 132 publications in 
["The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md). 
The two other studies have been reviewed previously, as noted below.
