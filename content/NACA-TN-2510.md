## Abstract  

>The results of surface-tension measurements for supercooled water
are presented. A total of 702 individual measurements of surface tension 
of triple-distilled water were made in the temperature range, 27°
to -22.2° C, with 404 of these measurements at temperatures below 0° C.
The increase in magnitude of surface tension with decreasing temperature, 
as indicated by measurements above 0° C, continues to
-22.2° C. The inflection point in the surface-tension-temperature relation 
in the vicinity of 0° C, as indicated by the International
Critical Table values for temperatures down to -8° C, is substantiated
by the measurements in the temperature range, 0° to -22.2° C. The surface 
tension increases at approximately a linear rate from a value of
76.96±0.06 dynes per centimeter at -8° C to 79.67±0.06 dynes per
centimeter at -22.2° C.

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
>The current interest in supercooled water is due in part to
increased research on aircraft icing, condensation shocks in supersonic 
flow, and natural and artificially induced precipitation. As
a result of this interest, a need has arisen for a more complete
understanding of the physical properties of supercooled water because
few of the physical properties of water have been investigated at temperatures 
much below 0° C.  
> 
>Surface tension is one of the physical properties of water that
influences the formation and growth of liquid-water droplets from air
saturated with water vapor. This condensation process very often
occurs at temperatures below 0° C in the atmosphere and in flowing gas
streams that are subject to adiabatic cooling. For a complete understanding 
of the condensation phenomenon at temperatures below 0° C,
the surface tension of water at these temperatures must therefore be
evaluated. The surface tension of water has been measured to -8° C
(reference 1), but some doubt exists as to the validity of the results
obtained below 0° C because of a weak inflection point in the surface-tension-temperature 
curve in the vicinity of 0° C. The validity of
this inflection point is questionable because of the experimental
difficulties involved in obtaining data at temperatures below 0° C.
Because of this uncertainty, extrapolation of the surface-tension-temperature 
relation to very low temperatures is difficult.  
> 
>The investigation reported herein was conducted to determine
experimentally the surface tension of water to as low a temperature as
possible. This information in combination with other facts concerning
the physical properties of supercooled water would be useful in determining 
the time-mean structure of supercooled water and the reasons
for the existence and apparent stability of supercooled water, as well
as droplet formation and growth from air saturated with water vapor at
temperature below 0° C.

> METHOD AND THEORY  
> 
> There are numerous methods for determining the surface tension of
liquids, for example, capillary rise, drop weight, and tensiometer
methods. Excellent summaries of most of the standard methods are presented 
in references 2 and 3. The standard methods, however, are
unsatisfactory for the determination of surface tension of supercooled
water for either or both of the following reasons:  
(1) Most methods require a knowledge of the density of the liquid,
which is unknown for supercooled water at temperatures considerably below 0° C.  
(2) The volume of liquid necessary for most of the standard methods
is so great that a high degree of supercooling is improbable.  
According to reference 4, as the volume of water is increased
the degree of supercooling possible decreases.  
> 
>The method adopted for this investigation is a very ingenious
method devised by Ferguson (reference 5) and modified by Ferguson and
Kennedy (reference 6). This method eliminates the disadvantages of the
more standard methods in that the density of the liquid under measurement 
need not be known and the volume of liquid required is less than
1 cubic millimeter. Essentially, the method is as follows: A small
quantity of water is place din a small-bore capillary tube that is
supported in a horizontal position (fig. 1). Pressure is applied to
one end of the tube until the liquid is forced into such a position
that the meniscus at the other ("open") end of the tube is plane instead
of curved. The pressure required to force the meniscus to a plane position 
is proportional to the surface tension.

>The method is based upon the same physical phenomenon that causes
a liquid to rise in a small-bore capillary tube; namely, the pressure
difference across a curved surface at a gas-liquid boundary.

>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE  
The apparatus used in this investigation consisted of the following
components (figs. 2 and 3): (1) a capillary tube for holding the water
sample, (2) a cold bath for cooling the capillary tube and water
sample, (3) a bellows and a rack and pinion gear arrangement for
changing the pressure applied to the water sample, (4) a micromanometer
to measure the applied pressure, (5) a light source and microscope
for determining when the meniscus at the "open" end of the capillary
tube is plane, and (6) a thermocouple and potentiometer for measuring
and recording the temperature of the water sample.

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

>A close inspection of the International Critical Table values presented 
in figure 7 or table I shows that the rate of increase in the
value of surface tension, with decreasing temperature, decreases from
27° to approximately 0° C and then starts to increase at lower temperatures; 
a weak inflection point in the surface-tension-temperature
curve must therefore exist in the vicinity of 0° C. Some doubt exists,
however, concerning the validity of the inflection point because of the
experimental difficulties involved in obtaining data at temperatures
below 0° C. In th temperature range, -8° to -22.2° C, however, the
measurements obtained. in this investigation are consistent with the
existence of this inflection point. The average values of surface
tension (fig. 7) indicate that surface tension increases at approximately
a linear rate from 76.96 ±0.06 dynes per centimeter at -8° C to
79.67±0.06 dynes per centimeter at -22.2° C, and the rate of increase of
surface tension with decreasing temperature is greater in the temperature
range, -5° to -22.2° C than in the range, 27° to -5° C.

## Conclusions  

>The surface tension of water in the supercooled region continues to
increase in magnitude with decreasing temperature, as it does above
0° C, and. reaches a value of 79.67±0.06 dynes per centimeter at 22.2° C.
The inflection point in the vicinity of 0° C indicated. by the International 
Critical Table values appears to be real and the rate of increase
of magnitude of surface tension with decreasing temperature is larger in
the temperature range, -5° to -22.2° C than in the range, 27° to -5° C.
