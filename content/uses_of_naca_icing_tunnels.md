_How much of a P-39 can one fit into an icing wind tunnel?_  

## Summary  
A wide variety of test articles were used in the NACA-era Icing Research Tunnel (IRT)  

## Key Points  
1. 37 publications were found describing the use of the IRT.  
2. A wide variety of test articles were used in the NACA-era Icing Research Tunnel  

## Discussion  

Readers are encouraged to see ["We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162), 
which includes information from NACA-era internal memos and interviews that I have not seen published elsewhere. 

There were five icing wind tunnels used by NACA. 
The majority of the tests were performed in the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) as NACA Lewis. 
The four other tunnels are briefly described in the "Other icing wind tunnel tests" section below. 

I found 37 NACA publications [^2] that discuss use of the NACA Icing Research Tunnel. 
Four more publications discuss the use of other icing wind tunnels. 

A wide variety of test articles were used.
These included (detailed further below):  
- A large portion of a P-39 airplane  
- engine nacelles  
- inlet and engine components
- icing instruments  
- radomes  
- several airfoils, including some with ice protection  
- cylinders  

Test purposes were varied. 
Purposes included:  
- ice shapes on unprotected components  
- efficacy of ice protection systems  
- limiting water ingestion and ice in inlets  
- calibrating icing instruments  
- ice prevention coatings  
- ice on propellers  
- impingement efficiency measurement (with the dye tracer method)  
- measure the aerodynamic effects of ice on airfoil sections  

Many tests were with full scale test articles 
(although, due to tunnel size limitations, sometimes limited span wing sections). 
Some were with scaled down test articles, 
and one with a scaled up test article (NACA-RM-E50H29, "The increased size was required to provide for
adequate instrumentation and is in accordance with current design trends")

The IRT has a turntable (vertical, floor and ceiling), which many test articles used. 
Some were floor mounted, and others had special purpose mounts.  

The nominal test section was used in most tests.  
However, some test articles were mounted in the upstream converging section or downstream expansion section.

### Test Articles in the NACA IRT  

_(In approximate chronological order)_  
Note that while NACA-RM-E50K10 was published in 1951, 
it contains data from a test conducted in 1945.
