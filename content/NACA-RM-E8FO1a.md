## Abstract  

>An investigation has been conducted In natural icing conditions
to determine the effect of ice formations on the performance of an
axial-flow turbojet engine. One flight was made in an icing condition 
in which the liquid.-water content varied from 0.077 to
0.490 gram per cubic meter and the average droplet size varied
from 5.4 to 12.1 microns. During a period of 60 minutes in icing,
at an engine speed of 11,000 rpm, the tail-pipe temperature increased
from 8650 to 9650 F and the jet thrust decreased from 1950 to
1700 pounds. Near the end of the icing period, the engine was
satisfactorily accelerated to take-off power.  

## Discussion  

As this publication is brief (12 pages, with seven of those photos), 
it is reproduced nearly in its entirety herein.  

The jet engine inlet in this case did not have ice protection.  

>INTRODUCTION  
An investigation has been conducted in natural icing conditions
at the NACA Cleveland laboratory to determine the effect of ice formation
on the performance of an axial-flow turbojet engine. Data presented
herein were obtained during one flight at an engine speed of
11,000 rpm, the normal cruising speed of the engine. Data obtained
on a previous flight at an engine speed of 9000 rpm are presented in
reference 1. During the icing condition, the engine was accelerated
to 12,000 rpm, or take-off power. Attempts will be made to obtain
additional performance data in other icing conditions.

>APPARATUS  
A 24C-2 turbojet engine was mounted on a four-engine bomber, which
was provided with anti-icing equipment for the wings, the tail
surfaces, and the propellers. General and close-up views of the
installation are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively. The turbojet
engine used. for this investigation has a 10-stage axial-flow compressor,
a two-stage turbine, and an annular combustion chamber. The characteristics 
of the engine are:  

```text
Maximum engine speed, rpm ..........12,000
Cruising engine speed, rpm .........11,000
Static-thrust rating, pounds .........2800
Maximum tail-pipe temperature, °F ....1220
```

>Instrumentation was provided at the compressor outlet for calculation 
of compressor efficiency and at the tail-pipe outlet for
calculations of air flow and thrust. A deflecting-vane-type flow-meter 
was used to measure the fuel flow to the engine.

> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
> 
>The ice formation obtained on the jet-engine cowling inlet is
shown in figure 3.

>The degree of ice accumulation on the engine
inlet is indicated by figures 4(a) and 4(b), which are side and
front views, respectively, of the engine inlet photographed after
landing. Very little ice, if any, collected on the engine-inlet
guide vanes. The ice shown at the bottom of the inlet guide vanes
is believed to consist of pieces broken from the ice formation on
the starter housing or the support struts.

>A time history of the
data taken in the icing condition is shown in figure 5. Engine
jet thrust, fuel flow, and tail-pipe temperature are shown in
figure 5(a); average droplet size, free-air temperature, and liquid-water 
content are shown in figure 5(b). Engine and icing data were
taken upon entering the icing cloud, and periodically during the
encounter with the icing condition, which lasted for approximately
1 hour. The engine speed was maintained at 11,000 rpm. A sudden
drop in engine thrust as the airplane entered the icing cloud is
believed to be a result of ice collection on the cowl lip, which
disrupted the air flow and destroyed the pressure recovery at the
compressor inlet.

>After 18 minutes in the icing condition, the engine returned
to nearly normal operation. Because of the very low liquid-water
content at that time (0.077 gram per cubic meter) and high free-air 
temperature (25° F), the ice accumulation on the engine inlet
melted and ran back along the cowling (fig. 5(b)).  
> 
> After 35 minutes, the liquid-water content rapidly rose to
0.49 gram per cubic meter (fig. 5(b)). The fuel flow then increased
to maintain the engine speed, which resulted in a corresponding
increase in tail-pipe temperature. At this point the thrust
rapidly decreased.  

>After 35 minutes, the liquid-water content gradually decreased
from 0.49 to 0.32 gram per cubic meter at the end of the run
(fig. 5(b)). The additional ice accumulation on the engine resulted
in a gradual increase in fuel flow and tail-pipe temperature and a
gradual decrease in jet thrust.  
> 
>At the end of 60 minutes, the thrust, the tail-pipe temperature,
and the fuel flow had stabilized (fig. 5(a)). During the icing
encounter, the thrust decreased from 1950 to 1700 pounds, the tail-
pipe temperature Increased, from 865° to 965° F, and the fuel flow
increased from 1890 to 1980 pounds per hour. During the time in the
Icing condition, the free-air temperature varied from 25° to 31° F,
the average droplet size varied from 5.4 to 12.1 microns, and the
liquid-water content varied from 0.077 to 0.490 gram per cubic meter
(fig. 5(b)).    
> 
>The engine was accelerated to take-off power of 12,000 rpm and
held at this speed for 2 minutes after approximately 45 minutes in
the icing condition. At the end of 2 minutes, the tail-pipe temperature 
had stabilized. The ice shown In the photographs resulted
in a thrust decreased at 12,000 rpm from 2455 to 2050 pounds and a
tail-pipe temperature increase from 1063° to 1139° F.  
> 
>No general conclusions may be drawn from these data, but no
serious reduction in engine performance would be experienced in an
icing condition similar to the one discussed.

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
The following results were obtained with an axial-flow turbojet engine 
in one icing encounter in natural icing conditions with
an average droplet size of approximately 10 microns, free-air
temperature of approximately 30° F, and liquid-water content varying
from 0.077 to 0.490 gram per cubic meter:  
>1. The tail-pipe temperature increased from 865° to 965° F
during an icing period of 60 minutes.  
>2. The engine jet thrust decreased from 1950 to 1700 pounds
during the same period.  
>3. The fuel flow increased from 1880 to 1980 pounds per hour
during the icing run.  
>4. Very little or no ice at all was believed to have collected
on the inlet guide varies or rotor.  
>5. The engine was satisfactorily accelerated to take-off power
after approximately 45 minutes in the icing condition.
