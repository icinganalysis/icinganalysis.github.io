## Introduction  

This is an excellent summary of the "state of the art" in 1955, 
and also summarizes many of the NACA achievements in aircraft icing 
(there were more after 1955.)

It is also a good introduction, although rather technical (but with no math) 
to aircraft icing, that has held up well for more than 6 decades.

Icing of aircraft components such as airfoil surfaces and engine-inlet
systems similar to those shown in figure 1 creates a serious operational
problem. Aircraft are now capable of flying in icing clouds without difficulty, 
however, because research by the NACA and others has provided the
engineering basis for icing protection systems. This paper summarises some
of the techniques used in NACA programs to solve aircraft icing problems and
indicates the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing
protection systems. In addition, appendixes A to C discuss the NACA Lewis
icing facilities in detail, specific test equipment and techniques used in
conducting tests in icing wind tunnels, and several icing instruments.

Icing of aircraft surfaces occurs when liquid cloud droplets cooled
below the freezing temperature impinge on a surface that is also below
freezing. All surfaces that are exposed to the direct impingement of super-cooled 
water droplets therefore may require icing protection (fig. 2). The
size and extent of icing on an airplane component is a function of cloud
liquid-water content, droplet size, and air temperature, physical dimensions
and shape of the component (size, shape, and attitude), and operating conditions 
(airspeed and altitude).

A body moving through a cloud of water droplets, in general. will not
intercept all the droplets originally contained in the volume of air swept
out by the projected frontal area of the body (fig. 3). 

![Figure 3. Droplet trajectories around airfoil.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%203.png)  

As the droplets
reach the vicinity of the body, the air streamlines flow around the body.
The droplets, because of their momentum, tend to maintain straight paths
toward the body; however, a drag force imposed by the relative velocity of
the air with respect to a droplet tends to cause the droplet to follow the
air streamlines. The relative magnitudes of the momentum and drag forces
determine the droplet path. The path of droplets in the flow field can be
determined analytically with particle trajectory equations. In order to do
this, however, the size of the cloud droplets must be known. This information 
has been obtained with instrumented aircraft in flight through icing
clouds. Two of the most widely used meth~ds of obtaining cloud icing data
are rotating multicylinders and the pressure-type icing-rate meter.
The rotating-multicylinder method has been used extensively to collect
data on both droplet-size distribution and liquid-water content in 
super-cooled clouds (refs. 1 to 4).

The collection of ice by the cylinders is similar to the collection of ice by airplane components. 
Therefore the
data obtained by this method have been valuable in designing icing protection 
systems for airplanes. In this method, several cylinders of different
diameter rotating on a common axis are exposed from an aircraft in flight or
in an icing tunnel to supercooled cloud droplets as shown in figure 4. 

![Figure 4. Multi-cylinders installed on aircraft.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%204.png)  

> A clearer version of the figure is from [NACA-RM-E53D23]({filename}NACA-RM-E53D23.md):  
>
> ![A photo of airplane with a multicylinder instrument protruding up from the top of the fuseloge, Figure 1 of NACA-RM-E53D23](/images/naca-rm-e53d23/Figure1.png)  

During the exposure period, the cylinders collect ice. The cylinders are 
rotated in order to obtain uniform ice collection around the circumference and
thereby to preserve a circular cross section.  

After exposure, the diameters ot the iced cylinders are measured and
the iced cylinders are weighed. The measurement of droplet size and water
content is based on the principle that cylinders of different sizes collect
different quantities of ice per unit frontal area. The ice collection of
each cylinder is expressed in terms of a collection efficiency that has been
obtained theoretically. The liquid water content, average droplet size, nnd
droplet-size distribution are obtained by a comparison of the measured
weight of ice collected on each cylinder with calculated values of collection 
efficiency. The method is applicable only in clouds where the temperature 
is below 0Â° C.

The pressure-type instrument (ref. 5) operates on the differential
pressure created when small total pressure holes plug with ice accretions,
as illustrated in the sketch of figure 5. 

![Figure 5. Pressure-type icing rate instrument.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%205.png)  

> A clearer version of part of the figure is from [NACA-RM-E51E16]({filename}modified%20pressure%20probe.md):  
>
> ![Figure 1. Principle of operation of NACA pressure-type icing-rate meter.](/images/naca-rm-e51e16/Figure 1.png)  

The small total-pressure holes in
the ice-collecting element, which are vented to static pressure through a
small orifice. are balanced against a nun-vented, ice-free total pressure in
a differential pressure switch. When these small total-pressure holes plug
from ice accretion, the pressure in the corresponding side of the pressure
switch approaches static by bleeding through the static orifice, and a 
differential pressure is erected between the iced and ice-free systems. 
Continuous operation is obtained by allowing the differential pressure switch
to energize an electrical heater that de-ices the ice-plugged total-pressure
holes. The pressures in the two systems then tend to equalize, opening the
pressure switch and allowing the cycle to be repeated. The heat-off time of
this cyclic process is used as a measure of the period of time required to
plug the holes. This period of time is a function of the rate at which ice
accumulates on the element containing the holes, because the amount of ice
accretion required for plugging is a constant value. The duration of the
heat-off period is calibrated against a measured icing rate. An NACA
flight-type film recorder is used to record continuously the duration of the
heat-off or icing period, the heat-on or de-icing period, the indicated air-
speed1 the air temperature and the altitude. The icing rate is then used
to calculate the water content of the icing cloud. This instrument is limited 
by water run-off at air temperatures near 0Â° C and high water contents, 
as are the rotating multi-cylinders. Also, it does not measure droplet size. 
Other icing instruments are discussed in appendix c.
 
In general, the average droplet size in icing clouds is in the range of
10 to 25 microns in diameter. In stratus clouds the maximum water content
is about 1.5 grams per cubic meter, while in cumulus clouds the water content
may be as high as 3.5 grams per cubic meter. Fortunately, these high water
contents extend over only a short horizontal distance. For cumulus clouds
the extent of such high water contents is only about 1/2 mile, while for
stratus clouds the high water contents usually do not exceed 10 to 20 miles.
The data obtained by the rotating-multicylinder method have been of
significance in establishing meteorological design criteria for aircraft
icing protection systems. These data, however, were based on flights by
only a few aircraft in deliberately sought icing conditions. The data from
the pressure-type meter have been obtained on a routine flight basis by a
cooperative program between the NACA, commercial airlines, and the United
States Air Force. Some 50 aircraft were instrumented with these meters in
various geographical areas of the world (fig. 6), including the North Atlantic, 
the continental United States, Alaska, the Pacific, and Japan. In addition, 
the program has been supplemented by in-flight weather reconnaissance 
reports from the Air Weather Service and Strategic Air Command aircraft 
over a two-year period. 

![Figure 6. World icing survey sites.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%206.png)  

These data have been put on punch cards and
are currently being analyzed on IBM equipment. Because most of the data
obtained from routine flights apply to low altitudes, special efforts are
being made to obtain data on the occurrence of icing at altitudes above
20,000 feet. Data obtained to date show that icing is rarely encountered
about 30,000 feet because of the infrequency of clouds containing liquid
water at the low temperatures associated with these altitudes. In addition,
the severity of icing encountered above 30,000 feet is usually low except in
scattered thunderstorm clouds.
 
The impingement characteristics and the initial rate of ice formation
on aircraft components can be obtained by either theoretical trajectory
studies or experimental means, once the water content and droplet sizes of
icing clouds are available. Most of the NACA analytical studies of droplet
trajectories about various bodies (refs. 6 to 13) utilize a differential
analyzer (fig. 7), since experience has shown that even the simplest manual
calculations are time-consuming and inaccurate. The use of the differential
analyzer in this work is described in reference 14.  
 
![Figure 7. Water-droplet-trajectory analog.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%207.png)

Typical results obtained from such a trajectory study are shown in figure 8, 
in which the local impingement rate on an airfoil is plotted as a
function of surface distance from the leading edge. The data shown are for
a 15 percent symmetrical airfoil of 8-foot chord, angle of attack of zero,
airspeed of 150 knots, and average droplet sizes of 8 and 15 microns. The
greatest impingement occurs at thP stagnation region and decreases rapidly
with surface distance from the leading edge. An increase in average droplet
size from 8 to 15 microns increases the local impingement rates and causes
the impingement area to extend farther aft than with the smaller droplets.

![Figure 8. Local impingement rates on a 15-percent thick symmetrical airfoil.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%208.png)  

The differential analyzer is difficult to use for droplet trajectories
about bodies with complex air flows. Therefore, a wind-tunnel method using
a dye-tracer technique (ref. 15) is often used to obtain experimentally the
droplet impingement on these bodies. In this technique (fig. 9), water
treated with known small quantities of water-soluble dye ia sprayed into the
airstream a large distance ahead of the body by nozzles. The surface of the
body is covered with blotter paper upon which the dyed water droplets impinge 
and are absorbed. At the point of droplet impact, a permanent dye
trace is obtained. The amount of dye obtained in a measured time interval
can be determined by a colorimetric analysis of punched-out segments of
blotted paper (fig. 9) and converted into the quantity of water that produced 
the dye trace. The maximum extent of impingement of the local dye or
water deposit over the entire wetted surface will yield the total amount of
water collected by the body. !hie experimental technique requires a knowledge 
of the droplet-size distribution and water content of the spray
cloud. Methods of obtaining these parameters have been worked out and are
included in the report concerning the technique (ref. 15).  

![Figure 9. Model used in obtaining experimental impingement data.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%209.png)  

The total water catch and the extent of impingement on an airfoil surface 
obtained by the differential analyzer are compared in figure 10 with
the experimental data (unpublished). These data are shown as a function of
an impingement parameter which. in this case, depends primarily on the droplet 
size squared, wing chord, and airspeed (ref. 16). These are typical
results for a 15 percent-thick symmetrical wing at zero angle of attack.

![Figure 10. Comparison of theoretical and experimental impingement data.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2010.png)  
 
From a knowledge of the droplet impingement characteristics and meteorological 
parameters, the local water impingement rate or icing rate on component 
surfaces can be calculated. Unfortunately, the shape of the resultant 
ice formation, which has a large effect on the aerodynamic penalties
associated with component icing, can only be estimated based on limited experimental 
data, since the ice-formation shape is also a function of airfoil
sweep angle, air temperature, and aircraft speed. Ice shapes can be generalized 
into two primary shapes, rime icing and heavy glaze icing (fig. 11).

![Figure 11. Typical airfoil ice formations.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2011.png)  

Rime icing is associated primarily with low air temperatures and results in
relatively streamlined ice formations that blend into the body shape and
cause little aerodynamic penalty. Heavy glaze icing results Â£rom high water
contents, large droplets, and surface temperatures near freezing. This 
combination of meteorological conditions causes rough ice formations that
protrude from the body surfaces into the airstream and cause large
aerodynamic penalties.
 
Early attempts to measure these penalties were made in flight through
icing clouds. However, the general advantages of doing icing research in a
tunnel where conditions can be controlled were recognized, and an icing research 
tunnel was built at the NACA Lewis laboratory. The Lewis icing tunnel 
is a single-return closed-throat tunnel, the general arrangement of
which is shown in figure 12. The test section is rectangular in shape, 9
feet wide, 6 feet high, and 20 feet long. The maximum tunnel airspeed with
icing condition and with a large model in the test section is about 260
knots. Air temperatures a1 low as -40Â° C can be obtained, although most
tests are conducted in the range of -3 to -20Â° C.  

![Figure 12. Plan view of icing tunnel.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2012.png)  

Icing conditions similar to those encountered in the atmosphere are
created by a battery of air-water atomizing nozzle. A view of the spray
system looking downstream into the test section is shown in figure 13. The
spray nozzles are mounted in six horizontal spray bars and located to give a
uniform cloud approximately 4- by 4-feet in the test section. This cloud
conforms to natural icing clouds measured in flight. Details of this icing
tunnel, its equipment and instrumentation, as well as of several high-speed
icing duct tunnels, are given in appendixes A and B. 

![Figure 13. Icing tunnel spray system.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2013.png)  

In order to determine the magnitude of the aerodynamic penalties associated 
with icing of lifting surfaces, airfoils of different sizes, thicknesses, 
and shapes were tested in the Lewis icing tunnel over a wide range
of angles of attack and icing conditions (refs. 17 and 18). Section-drag
measurements during icing were obtained by means of an integrating wake survey 
rake (fig. 14) and the tunnel force-measuring balance system. Lift and
pitching moments were also measured with the balance system.  

![Figure 14. Model used to study aerodynamic penalties caused by icing.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2014.png)   

A typical lift and drag curve for an NACA 0011 airfoil at an angle of
attack of 2.3Â° is shown in figure 15 as a function of time in glaze icing,
together with a picture of that ice formation at the end of 18 minutes of
icing (unpublished data). It is apparent that under these operating conditions 
the loss in lift of 12 percent and the increase in section drag of 270
percent after 18 minutes of icing could constitute a serious problem for an
aircraft.

![Figure 15. Changes in lift and drag caused by icing.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2015.png)  

Ice formations on aircraft components can be prevented by flowing or
spraying temperature-depressant fluids over the component surfaces (ref. 19)
or by heating the surfaces (refs. 18 to 23). The work of the NACA has emphasized 
the use of heat for icing protection. Component icing can be prevented 
by thermal means in two ways: (1) The surfaces can be raised to a
temperature just sufficient to maintain the impinging water in a liquid
state over the entire surface, or (2) the surfaces can be supplied sufficient 
heat to evaporate the impinging water in a specified distance aft of
the impingement area while the remainder of the surface is unheated. Obviously, 
it takes more heat per unit surface area to evaporate the water than
to maintain the same surface just above 0Â° C. Calculations show, however
(ref. 23), that the total area that requires heating must also be considered
in evaluating the total heat requirement. Therefore, the size of the component 
will generally influence which of the two methods of ice prevention is
used.
 
The heat supplied to a component fot icing protection (fig. 16) warms
the impinging water to the component surface temperature and evaporates part
or all of the impinging water. Some heat is lost to the ambient air by 
convection. The relative magnitude of the external heat losses shown in 
figure 16 are typical for anti-icing a wing surface and are shown as a function
of surface distance aft of an airfoil leading edge. In addition, some of
the heat is lost to adjacent structure by conduction. The external heat-transfer 
processes from a heated, wetted surface were postulated by J. K.
Hardy (refs. 24 and 25). 

![Figure 16.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2016.png)  

The processes were substantiated by in-flight data
obtained by the staff of the NACA Ames laboratory (ref. 20). The Ames tests
employed an aircraft with electrically heated dorsal wings (fig. 17). The
electrically heated airfoils were instrumented with thermocouples (fig. 18)
that, with the conductivity and thickness of the material known, the internal 
heat loss could be calculated. Because of the thin outer skin, the
chordwise heat conduction was considered negligible. Hence, the external
local heat transfer was obtained from the total power input and the internal
heat loss. 

![Figure 17. C-46 aircraft with thermally anti-iced airfoil model.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2017.png)

![Figure 18. Typical electric heater construction for C-46 flight studies.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2018.png)  

Typical results obtained from these studies are shown in figure 16.
These data show that the heat for evaporating the impinging water and that
lost to the ambient air by convection are approximately equal. The heat
required to raise the impinging water to the surface temperature is only a
small fraction of the total heat input. At the leading edge the heat flow
is about 3900 Btu/(hr)(sq ft), while aft of the impingement area the local
heat flow is 2400 Btu/(hr)(sq ft) or less.
 
In order to demonstrate that the results obtained in icing conditions
in the tunnel were the same as those obtained in flight, a wing section carried 
on the C-46 aircraft during the Ames laboratory flight tests was also
tested in the icing tunnel, and the data were compared (ref. 21). The results 
showed that in similar icing conditions, as determined by measurements
of the cloud conditions by similar instruments, the data agreed satisfactorily.
 
For high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, the icing-protection heat requirements 
(due to changes in heat transfer and evaporation considerations
influenced by speed and altitude) of a thermal anti-icing system are excessive. 
For example, calculations showed that the heat required for evaporating 
all the water impinging on a jet powered transport exceeds 7,000,000
Btu/hr. Since this heat would be taken from the jet engines, a severe 
performance penalty would result (ref. 23).
 
In order to reduce the thermal requirements for airframe components,
cyclic de-icing systems were studied. In cyclic de-icing, ice is permitted
to form on the airplane surfaces and is then removed periodically by a short
intense application of heat. During the heating period, the bond between
the surface and the ice is melted and the ice is removed by aerodynamic forces. 
Only a few components or sections of a component are heated at a time,
the rest being allowed to ice. Because the components are heated successively, 
proper grouping of the components permits shifting of heat from one
group to another and thereby maintaining a constant heat load. The icing or
heat off time is determined by the amount of ice that can be tolerated on a
component without seriously affecting its performance.  
 
Numerous thermal cyclic de-icing systems were studied in the Lewis
icing tunnel, typical of which was the hot gas cyclically de-iced airfoil
shown schematically in figure 19. The initial NACA de-icing consisted of a
conventional double akin, a two-way hot gas supply duct with valves for 
cycling the hot gas into the plenum or D-duct running spanwise at the leading
edge, and a conducting fin attached to the supply duct and airfoil akin at
the leading edge near the stagnation region (ref. 26). A two-way gas supply
duct was used so that the hot gas would flow outboard and return in an ad
joining rear passage in order to maintain a constantly hoc supply line. The
valve in the supply line open in spanwise sequence, thereby permitting a
constant flow of gas in the forward passage and greatly avoiding thermal
lags. Because the forward passage is continuously heated, the fin conducts 
heat to the akin at the stagnation region, thereby providing a narrow ice-free 
spanwise parting atrip. This ice-free parting strip splits the ice cap
that usually forms over the nose of the airfoil and facilitates ice removal
by aerodynamic forces during the heating period.

![Figure 19. NACA air heated cyclically de-icing wing.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2019.png)  

The model was extensively instrumented with thermocouples in the akin
and structural members and in the air passages in chordwise planes at
several spanwise locations. Flow to the various sections was carefully
metered by orifices in the air-supply lines. Timing of the fast-acting
pappet-type cycle valves was made with electronic timers.
 
The results obtained from extensive studies of this model (refs. 26 and 27) 
show that savings in total heat input of as much as 75 to 90 percent of
the heat required to prevent ice on the same wing were achieved. Similar
results were obtained at both the NACA (ref. 28) and NAE facilities with
electrically de-iced airfoils. Subsequent studies with a 36Â° swept wing
(ref. 17) show that the tangential air-flow component along the span is 
sufficient to eliminate the need of a spanwise ice-free parting strip for
facilitating removal of the ice formation. Systems similar to the NACA hot-air 
cyclic de-icing systems are currently being used by some manufacturers
in the latest jet aircraft.
 
The use of a cyclic de-icing system necessitates an evaluation of the
aerodynamic penalties associated with the ice formations permitted to build
up during the unheated portion of a cycle (fig. 20). A number of airfoil
models were tested to obtain the drag characteristics of cyclically de-iced
airfoils in icing conditions (refs. 17 and 18). The results of these tests
show that the drag and lift changes averaged over a cycle do not constitute
a serious operational hazard if the length of the cy~le can be adjusted to
the severity of the icing condition.

![Figure 20. ](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2020.png)  

In addition to thermal de-icing systems, ice can be removed from most
airfoil surfaces by a mechanical de-icing system consisting of a high-pressure 
pneumatic boot (fig. 21). In this system, inflatable tubes are
sandwiched between two layers of rubber or neoprene. When ice forms on the
outer surface of the boot, compressed air is bled periodically into the
tubes which then inflate for a period of 3 to 6 seconds. Vacuum is applied
to the tubes to maintain the surface flush during the off part of the
cycle. Studies in the icing tunnel show that these deicers will effectively 
remove the main ice formations, however, the small flakes of residual ice
adhering after the removal cycle will cause a section-drag increase of up to
about 30 percent (unpublished data). Experimental studies indicate that
removal of these residual ice formations by sublimation is a long process
(ref. 29). These drag increases, therefore, can penalise aircraft performance 
over a much longer portion of the entire flight than for juat the dura
tion of the icing encounter.

![Figure 21. Pneumatic boot de-icing system.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2021.png)  

The engine is the most vital component on the airplane requiring icing
protection. Work on icing protection for engine air inlets and induction
systems covered piston and jet engines. The work on piston engines, summarized 
in an NACA technical report (ref. 30), led to the recomnendations incorporated 
in figure 22 for a typical arrangement of an engine induction
system. Such a design includes (1) an air inlet, which reduces the intake
of water and snow to a minimum by utilizing the inertia and momentum differences 
between air and water particles to separate the droplets out of the
air at the inlet, (2) aerodynamically clean flow passages to prevent ice
accretion on exposed parts, (3) air-metering device, located in a warm, dry
region, (4) throttle and throttle bodies kept above freezing, and (5) fuel
injected downstream of the heated surfaces to prevent fuel-evaporation
icing. Aircraft that incorporate many of these features, including the
inlet type shown, are the Convair-240 and some versions of the Lockheed Constellation. 

![Figure 22. Ice protection for piston engine-induction system.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2022.png)  
 
The high speeds of jet-powered aircraft and the large engine air flows
necessitated a reappraisal of the icing problem for jet engines compared
with that for the reciprocating engine. While the early centrifugal jet
engines were not generally critical with respect to inlet and engine icing,
because of engine geometry and structure, the axial-flow engine, were adversely 
affected by icing. The icing of engine inlet guide vanes (refs. 31
to 33) and inlet screens constituted an icing hazard (fig. 23) that not only
reduced the available thrust and increased specific fuel consumption but
could cause engine failure. The icing hazard of fixed inlet screen was
aptly demonstrated by the simultaneous loss of eight F-84 aircraft over
Indiana after a brief encounter with severe icing conditions in 1951. Tests
in the Lewis icing tunnel also showed that the pressure loss associated with
icing of guide vanes could cause large pressure losses and hence thrust losses 
(ref. 33). Several icing protection systems using alcohol or hot gas
injection into the airstream to provide protection for the screen, accessory
housing, and guide vanes were studied by NACA and NAE. With these systems,
however, contamination of the compressor air (which is often used for cabin
pressurization) or large thrust losses resulted.

![Figure 23. Typical icing of jet engine inlet.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2023.png)  

The use of thermal icing protection for most engine components appeared
most feasible. In the case of the screen, however, electro-thermal means
did not appear attractive because uf the large heating rates required. 
Consequently, the complete elimination of the screen or retraction during an
icing encounter appeared mandatory. Elimination of the screen exposed the
engine to damage from ice chunks breaking off from unprotected components
ahead of the compressor and entering the engine. Practically all types of
axial-flow engines tested at the military services Mt. Washiqton icing facility 
have suffered partial or complete engine failure from insestion of
such ice chunks. Thermal icing protection is required, therefore, for all
components of the engine inlet that may shed these ice chunks if left unprotected.

In the axial-flow engine the inlet guide vanes upstream of the compressor ice quickly. 
Complete icing protection of these members is required if the engine is to function in 
icing conditions. A study of means for heating the guide vanes internally with hot air 
was conducted with a cascade of five vanes mounted in a rectangular duct set in the icing 
tunnel (fig. 24). 
 
![Figure 24. Model used in guide vane studies.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2024.png)  

Ice collected on the Leading and trailing edges of the highly cambered blades used for 
inlet guide vanes. For this reason, a saving of 50 percent of the heating air flow 
(fig. 25) is achieved if the interior of the vane is partitioned to restrict this hot air 
to the areas of the blade on which ice collects. This partitioning of guide vanes has been 
adopted for some current engines.

![Figure 25. Heat savings obtained by guide vane partitioning.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2025.png)  

Because the engine accessory dome collects ice that may break off after reaching a 
destructive size and enter the engine, research was conducted on the heating requirements 
for several jet-engine accessory domes. An electrical icing protection system was used in 
order to obtain selective and controlled heating and thereby verify theoretical local 
heat-transfer data (ref. 22 and unpublished data). The domes were tested also with rotation 
to simulate turboprop installations in order to study the effect of rotation on heating 
requirements. In general, the rotational effect was negligible for the size models tested.
 
While it is apparent that aircraft operating at relatively low air-speeds 
and at altitudes less than 20,000 feet will require airframe icing 
protection equipment, high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, on the other hand, 
may require little if any such equipment. These aircraft cruise at altitudes 
where little or no icing occurs. Studies in high-speed icing duct 
tunnels (refs. 34 to 36) show that icing can occur at speeds up to a Mach 
number of approximately 1.3; however, because of aerodynamic heating of the 
surfaces at this high speed, such icing conditions would require low air 
temperatures. The frequency of encountering severe icing at low air temperatures 
on a statistical probability basis is almost negligible. The icing 
problem for these aircraft, therefore, is confined primarily to climb and 
let down conditions. Because of their high rates of ascent and descent, the 
icing encounters for these aircraft are of short duration. Consequently, 
the flight plan and aircraft mission are becoming increasingly more important 
in determining the necessity for airframe icing protection equipment.  
 
A limited operational analysis of an interceptor and a transport aircraft 
was presented in a paper by the author at an NACA conference on Some 
Problems of Aircraft Operation (Nov. 17-18, 1954). This study showed that 
thin-winged interceptor aircraft with a high rate of climb and descent and 
cruising at high altitude do not appear to require an airframe icing protection 
system except possibly during a landing operation. This study suggested 
that a partial or a simple one-shot icing protection system could be 
installed at minimum weight, structural, and performance penalty to cope 
with an icing encounter during landing. The study also concluded that jet 
transports, because of their slower rates of ascent and descent, should be 
provided with an airframe icing protection system. Since the engine is so 
vulnerable to ice damage, complete engine protection is required for both types of aircraft.  
 
In summary, therefore, the NACA research programs have provided sufficient 
data or have established techniques whereby icing-protection requirements 
for most aircraft components can be determined sufficiently accurately 
for engineering purposes. The data obtained have been generalized whenever 
possible; however, it is recognized that certain specific installations at 
present still require testing in an icing tunnel or in flight. Meteorological 
studies are providing sufficient information on conditions conducive to 
icing on which to base the design requirements of aircraft components and to 
determine the need of icing protection for specific aircraft and flight 
plans. While this paper deals primarily with NACA studies in icing research, 
the contributions of other agencies including the groups operating 
at the Mt. Washington facilities, the U.S. military establishments, the 
U. S. aviation industry, the Canadian NAE, and other groups in the United 
States, Great Britain, and France must also be recognized. All these groups have 
cooperated and exchanged ideas that have aided in the successful solution 
of many icing problems.

APPENDIX A
ICING TUNNEL FACILITIES

The amount of time required for both aircraft and equipment maintenance
to obtain sufficient data in flight toward the solution of icing problems,
together with the difficulty of obtaining data in specified, controlled
icing conditions, resulted in the design and construction of an icing wind
tunnel at the NACA Lewis laboratory in 1943-1944.

The Lewis icing tunnel ia a single-return closed-throat tunnel, the
general arrangement of which is shown in figures 12 and 26. The tunnel is
constructed of steel plate and is insulated with a 3-inch thickness of 
Fiberglas. The outer nonstructural shell covering the insulation is made of
1/8-inch steel sheets.

![Figure 26. Lewis icing tunnel facility.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2026.png)  

The tunnel is anchored at each end of the test section and at each end
of the drive motor and supported by columns and sliding expansion joints at
all other points in order lo allow movement due to temperature stresses.
The over-all size of the tunnel shell is about 198 feet long and about 75
feet wide. The test section and a portion of the entrance core and diffuser
ars surrounded by a steel housing to provide space for the essential test
equipment and operating personnel. This space is called the test chamber.
Because the test section is vented to the chamber, the air pressure decreases 
in the chamber during operation of the tunnel (normally less than 3 in.
Hg). An air lock is provided lo permit access by personnel to the chamber
during a run.

The test chamber contains three floor levels:
the ground floor, containing electrical, thermocouple, water, and balance-scale 
equipment; the
second floor, containing the test section of the tunnel and the various controls, 
manometers, recording instruments, and associated equipment; and the
third floor, containing auxiliary measuring equipment. Personnel access to
the tunnel is generally from the second floor of the test chamber, while
models are lowered into the test section from the third floor through a removable 
48- by 140-inch access hatch in the roof of the test section.

The test section is rectangular in shape, 9 feet wide, 6 feet high, and
20 feet long. The air enters the test section from a large rectangular section 
giving a contraction ratio of about 14 to 1. The test section of the
tunnel is provided with a turntable on which models can be mounted, as well
as side-wall trunnion mounts. The maximum tunnel airspeed with icing conditions 
and a large model in the test section is 260 knots.

Windows are provided on both sides and in the roof of the tunnel test
section to allow observation of models during a test, The windows in the
tunnel sides are laminated, electrically heated units similar to windshields
on many aircraft, while the windows in the test section roof are unheated.
The power supplied to the new window, currently being installed is 500 watt,
per square foot. The temperature of the plastic inner layer of the window
is detected by a nickel wire element. Thia element is used in a bridge circuit 
to control the window temperature.

Turning vane, are used in all right-angle corner, of the tunnel. The
vane downstream of the test section and ahead of the drive fan are 
steam-heated to prevent icing.

The drive motor for the tunnel develop, 4160 horsepower. The drive
consists of a doubly fed wound-rotor induction motor. Power is supplied
directly to the 1tator, while the power for the rotor is supplied by a four-machine 
variable and fixed frequency setup. A variable-speed d-c motor,
driven according to the Ward-Leonard system, drives an a-c generator. The
generator applies the power to the tunnel drive-motor rotor. The speed of
the drive motor is governed by the speed of the a-c generator or d-c motor,
the speed of these machines being controlled by varying the voltage to the
d-c motor. The drive motor has a speed range from O to 540 rpm. A 200,000-
cubic-foot-per-minute, 5O-horsepower blower is used to cool the drive motor.

The tunnel drive motor is coupled directly to a 25-foot-diameter drive
fan with 12 blades. The fan blades are wooden, with the leading edges of
the blades protected by neoprene abrasion shoes. Stationary contra-vanes
are used ahead of the fan.

A ventilating tower is located downstream of the drive motor. Thia
tower permits an exchange of tunnel air with outside air. The primary use
of this unit has been to provide an additional cooling load to help regulate
the tunnel air temperature for certain test conditions. In addition, a
finned-tube heat exchanger with a capacity of 5,000,000 Btu per hour is
available to aid in regulating the tunnel air temperature.  

A compression-type refrigeration system located in a nearby building is
used to cool the tunnel air to the required icing condition. The tunnel is
cooled by passing the air over a bank of refrigerated finned heat exchangers
located in an area between the drive motor and the tunnel spray system. The
total refrigeration capacity is about 7700 tons. The normal cooling load
for the icing tunnel requires from 1200 to 2100 tons; however, this requirement 
varies with climatic conditions. Air temperatures as low as -40Â° C
can be obtained, although moat tests are conducted in the range of -3Â° to
-20Â° C.

Icing conditions similar to those encountered in the atmosphere are
created by a battery of air-water atomising nozzles. A view of the spray
system looking downstream into the test section is shown in figure 13. The
spray nozzles are mounted in six horizontal spray bars and located to give a
uniform cloud approximately 4- by 4-feet in the test section. Controls for
the spray system are located in airfoil-shaped enclosures at one end of each
strut.

A sketch of the air-water atomizing nozzles used in the spray system is
shown in figure 27. The nozzle assembly consists of air and water supply
lines, steam line to prevent icing of the entire strut, and the spray nozzle
(Inconel). Approximately 80 nozzles are used to obtain an adequate cloud in
the tunnel. The nozzles were specially developed for the tunnel to yield
droplet sizes ranging from a mean effective size of 4 micron at low water
flow, to about 20 micron, at maximum water flowa. Air pressures of 60 to 80
pounds per square inch are used normally to atomize the water, while the
water pressures range from a few pounds above the air-pressure values up to
140 pounds per square inch. The large water-pressure values correspond to
large water flows and large droplet sizes. The droplets produced by these
nozzles are not uniform in size but vary approximately in accordance with a
Langmuir D or E drop-size distribution (ref. 37). For a constant water
flow, the liquid-water content in the tunnel varies with the airspeed. In
addition, the contraction of the tunnel entrance cone affects the droplet
paths and local water concentration in the tunnel. Consequently, maximum or
minimum values of water content and droplet size independent of tunnel air-speed 
cannot be stated explicitly.

![Figure 27. Cross section of NACA air-water atomizing spray nozzle.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2027.png)  

The water used for the spray system passes through a 500-gallon-per-
hour-capacity demineralizer. The demineralizer consists of two anion and
cation filter beds that remove all minerals from the water, thereby preventing 
fouling and plugging of the spray system. From the demineralizer, the
water is piped into a storage tank with a capacity of 750 gallons. The
storage tank is kept full by a float switch that turns the demineralizer on
and off to maintain a given water level in the storage tank. From the storage 
tank the water is piped to two turbine water pumps with a capacity of 5
gallons per minute each at 15O pounds per square inch gage. The water is
pumped through three rotameters for flow measurement and then into a steam
heat exchanger that heats the water to a temperature of 80Â° to 90Â° C.
Heating of the water is necessary to prevent freeze-out of the water when it
is air-atomized to cloud droplets in the tunnel. Following the heat exchanger 
the water is filtered at each strut control box. The water pressure is
regulated at each strut by a pressure regulator controlled by the tunnel
operator. The water pressure is sensed by a pressure transmitter, which
changes water pressure to pneumatic pressure. The water pressures in each
spray strut (in the form of pneumatic pressure) are indicated on a manometer
board in the test chamber.

Air is furnished to the water-spray system from a service air line with
a capacity of 6 pounds per second at 120 pounds per square inch. This air
is passed through a pressure regulator, a steam heat exchanger (which heats
the air to approximately 80Â° to 90Â° C), and a two-stage filter before
entering the strut control boxes. The air pressure is also controlled from
the test-chamber control area.

A separate spray system consisting of 4 to 9 nozzles is used to inject
dyed water into the tunnel for experimental studies of droplet impingement
characteristics of various bodies (ref. 15).

A balance frame is provided with a 6-component force-measuring scale
system. Data are recorded automatically on tapes at each balance. Electrically 
heated co-axial pressure tubes are used to obtain pressure data. All
pressure data are recorded photographically from multi-tube manometer
boards. Temperature data obtained with copper-constantan thermocouples are
recorded on automatic flight recorders. The control equipment includes variable 
transformers for power control to models, automatic temperature controller 
for heated air to models, and various recording instruments for
heat-source control. Standard instruments are used to record tunnel air-speed 
and air temperature. An NACA pressure-type icing-rate meter is used
to measure the liquid-water content of the tunnel atmosphere. Special 
instrumentation is added whenever required for a particular study.

Heated air for providing models with icing protection is supplied by
three heat exchangers. The air from these exchangers is heated by the exhaust 
from a jet-engine combustion can. Each heat exchanger has a flow capacity 
of 1000 pounds per hour with pressure regulation up to 120 pounds per
square inch. Orifices in each line allow a measurement of the flow from
each exchanger. Constant air temperature over a wide range of air flows is
obtained byan automatic flow control that regulates the amount of cold air
permitted to mixÂ·with heated air from the exchangers.

Electric heating supplied to models for icing protection can be obtained 
from either a-c or d-c sources; however, a-c is generally preferred. 
The d-c system capacity is 28 volts and rated at 100 amperes. In addition,
a 12-volt d-c system rated at 50 amperes is also available. A 29-volt a-c
system rated at 50 amperes is available and is used for heater studies for
which the heater load is normally run on d-c. A 110-volt single-phase system 
and a 208-volt, three-phase, 50-ampere system are available for large
electrical loads. Selective power inputs (a-c three-phase system) to electrically 
heated models are metered (power recorded on a recording wattmeter)
by means of 18 variable transformers rated at 3 amperes, 16 variable transformers 
rated at 9 amperes, and 3 variable transformers rated at 45 anr
peres. A 400-cycle inverter capable of supplying 1,500 volt-amperes at 115
volts is also used for some instrument tests.

Electronic timers are available by which specified heating and icing
periods for either electric or air heating systems can be controlled.

The 136-inch-high multi-tube manometer board is so arranged that it may
operate as an integrating type or a standard board. A total of 298 readings
can be obtained from the board. Additional U-tube and standard manometer
boards are available as required. Most of the tubes are also connected to
an air-purge system by which air is bled through the tubes back to the
model. An air-operated cylinder or pincher closes off the tubes at the manometer 
to prevent the purge air from blowing the manometer fluid out of the
bonds. The purge air prevents the entry of water from the spray cloud into
the tubes and blocking or freezing of the unheated portions of the pressure
lines. During this purging procedure, no manometer-board readings are taken.

For aerodynamic studies of airfoils in icing conditions, the airfoil
surfaces aft of the region protected by the icing protection system (called
afterbody) are generally heated. This heating is required, since the
turbulence level and supersaturated air in the test section cause a frost
deposit on the cold portions of a model. These deposits have rarely been
observed in natural flight icing. Such frost deposits increase the measured
model drag. A steam line operating at +5 to -3 inches of mercury is used to
heat these afterbodies. To avoid steam leakage from the model into the
tunnel, the afterbody is operated at a negative pressure by means of a small
ejector and a barometric condensor located externally of the model.

Photographs of ice formations during a test are obtained with high-speed 
electronic flash equipment, while conventional camera equipment is
used for pictures taken in the tunnel at the conclusion of a test. Color
photography has proved to be the most satisfactory for movie film recording
of data in the presence of the spray cloud.

Airfoil models normally span the vertical height of the tunnel. Chords
of these models have ranged from 13 to 96 inches or larger. Horizontal
model mounting has also been used occasionally; however, because of wind-
tunnel-wall interference effects, the vertical mounting is preferred.
Bodies of revolution and inlets tested are normally less than 36 inches in
diameter.

In addition to the 6- by 9-foot icing tunnel, two smaller high-speed
icing-duct tunnel facilities are also used. Techniques equivalent to those
just described are used in these tunnels. A schematic diagram of the 3.84-
by 10-inch tunnel presented in figure 28 shows the inlet diffuser section
with screens, the plenum chamber with flow straightening tubes, the bell-mouth 
tunnel entry, the test section, and the outlet diffuser section. The
tunnel is designed to provide a range of subsonic Mach numbers from 0.3 to
0.8 and a supersonic Mach number of 2.0. Altitudes up to 30,000 feet may be
simulated.

![Figure 28. NACA 3.84 x 10-inch high speed icing duct tunnel.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2028.png)  

A supply of refrigerated air initially at approximately -20Â° F and
with a specific humidity of 5.0x10-4 pound of water per pound of dry air
is conditioned to provide the desired temperatures and humidities at the
tunnel test section. The humidity of the airstream is controlled by means
of steam injected at a point sufficiently far upstream to ensure thorough
mixing at the tunnel entry.

One wall of the tunnel contains a large glass section for observation
and visual measurements. The other wall has five portholes for access to
the inside of the tunnel and removable plugs for installation of instrumentation 
at various stations along the tunnel. Permanent instrumentation of
the tunnel at the test section includes static-pressure taps along the top
and bottom surfaces of the tunnel and pressure taps and thermocouples in the
plenum chamber.

A schematic diagram of the component parts of a 12- by 12-inch icins
duct tunnel is shown in figure 29. The tunnel characteristics are in general 
similar to the 3.84 - by 10-inch tunnel. Subsonic speeds up to Mach
number of 0.75 can be achieved with small airfoil models. For icing studies
the airspeed is maintained in the subsonic and low supersonic speed ranges.

![Figure 29. NACA 12 x 12-inch high speed icing duct tunnel.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2029.png)  

## Appendix B {: #appendix-b }  

OPERATIONAL TECHNIQUES
 
The following are techniques used for model testing in the Lewis icing
tunnel and associated facilities.
 
Thermocouple Installations
 
Whenever possible, all skin or surface thermocouples (copper-constantan) 
are peened into small holes drilled into the surface as shown in figure 30. 
The ball at the junction of the thermocouple is just large enough to
fit into the hole, so that peening the surface around the ball will result
in a firmly anchored thermocouple. The ball should be as close to the outer
surface of the skin as possible. For very thin metal skins (0.005-inch
stainless steel, e.g.) spot-welding the thermocouple on the inner surface of
the skin is acceptable. The thermocouple leads should not be secured on the
outer surface of the model, since ice will anchor on the leads. If splicing
of thermocouple leads is required, such splices should be made in a protected, 
constant-temperature location, outside the model in the test chamber.
All thermocouple leads should be protected against moisture; asbestos-covered 
wires are not generally recommended for models in icing conditions.
Shielded thermocouples are recommended for obtaining measurements of hot air
temperature, although a trailing thermocouple such as that shown in figure
30(b) is acceptable.

![Figure 30. Thermocouple installation details.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2030.png)  

Tunnel Air Temperature

The tunnel air temperature is obtained with a probe that separates the
entrained water from the airstream as shown in figure 31. 

![Figure 31. Inertia-separation temperature probe.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2031.png)  

The probe consists 
of a nose and rear cap and a housing containing a temperature-sensing
element. Holes are located in the housing so that the air flows through the
probe from the rear to the front of the probe. The locations of these holes
are based on pressure-distribution studies. The water droplets, because of
their inertia, do not enter the housing at the rear locations.Because the
nose-cap diameter is larger than the housing diameter, the housing is protected 
from icing. The nose cap is allowed to ice. Thermal icing protection 
could be incorporated in the nose cap; however, an error in the indicated 
temperature would be incurred. The average. temperature-recovery factor
for these probes is about 84 percent and is constant over a range of Mach
numbers from 0.2 to 1.0. In the NACA icing tunnel the probes are used to
measure air temperature in the low-speed section upstream of the spray system 
and ahead of the contraction cone. The air temperature measured by
these probes is therefore essentially a total air temperature. Because the
tunnel is always at least saturated when the sprat system is used, the ambient-air 
temperature in the test section is computed by conventional wet-air
equations (ref. 21). The total air temperature measured in the low-speed
section of the tunnel is used for a base in these calculations.

Temperatures from Rotating Bodies

A typical means used to transmit the temperatures from a rotating body
to a recorder ia shown schematically in figure 32. The thermocouple leads
from the body are fed through a hollow motor shaft to the rear of a motor
housing and through a thermocouple selector switch into a steam-filled jacket 
that rotates with the shaft. From the rotating jacket, copper leads are
attached to a slip-ring and brush assembly. From this assembly a copper
leads are again led into a steam-filled stationary jacket. Copper-constantan 
leads are used from the stationary jacket to a thermocouple selector
unit and to a flight recorder. The steam jacket is used to provide a constant 
temperature at critical junctions in the thermocouple circuit, where
the wire metal in the thermocouple leads is changed from copper and constantan 
to all copper and back again.

![Figure 32. Schematic diagram for temerature measuring system on rotating bodies.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2032.png)  

Pressure Tubes

In icing conditions all pressure tubes subject to water impingement
(pitot-static tubes, tubes in survey rakes and in the boundary layer, etc.)
must be protected against icing. In the Lewis icing tunnel such pressure
tubes are generally electrically heated. A co-axial tube is used consisting
of two concentric tubes separated by a woven glass sleeving insulation
(fig. 33). The ends of the tubes exposed to the airstream are silver-soldered 
and shaped to obtain either static or total-pressure tubes. Tube
sizes of 0.093- to 0.437-inch outside diameter and 0.057- to 0.393-inch inside 
diameter with wall thicknesses of 0.005 inch are in common usage.
These tubes are made of Inconel. A special tube bender was developed by
NACA personnel to avoid collapsing of the co-axial tubing during bending of
the tubes to a desired shape.

![Figure 33. Details of electrically heated pressure tubes.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2033.png)  

Surface Pressure from Rotating Body

A scheme similar to that used to obtain temperatures from rotating bodies 
is also used to obtain surface pressure measurements. Pressure lines
from a model are fed into a hollow shaft (fig. 34). Each tube is then allowed 
to vent into a chamber composed of the hollow shaft, bearings, and a
stationary housing. All pressure sealing is accomplished by the bearings
and felt seals. The pressure from each sealed chamber is then transmitted
to a manometer. A water-jacket cooling system (not shown) is provided for
high-rotational-speed operation. This pressure system permits simultaneous
readings of many pressures and is generally limited only by the number of
bearings used.

![Figure 34. Schematic diagram for pressure measuring system on rotating bodies.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2034.png)  

##  APPENDIX C {: #appendix-c }   

ICING INSTRUMENTS

The determination of liquid-water content and droplet-size distribution
of natural and artificial clouds has received considerable attention in connection 
with cloud physics studies and, in particular, in aircraft icing
studies. A knowledge of the liquid-water content and droplet-size distribution 
in clouds is of fundamental importance in evaluating rate and area of
ice formation on various aircraft components, rate and area of erosion by
impinging droplet, on various aircraft surfaces such as radmes, reduction
of visibility, attenuation of radar, and the basic mechanism of cloud formation 
and precipitation.

Numerous methods for determining these parameters have been proposed
and tested, but each method suffers limitations as to accuracy or ease in
obtaining or reducing the data to useful form. In some cases the limitations 
become very severe when measurements are attempted in high-speed air-streams. 
In addition to the rotating multicylinders and pressure-type
icing-rate meter discussed in the test, some methods and techniques that
have been widely employed to determine liquid-water content and/or droplet
size are:

(1) Cloud camera  
(2) Oil slides  
(3) Oil-stream aeroscope  
(4) Heated probes  

The methods are described and discussed in references 38 to 40.
The use of cameras (fig. 35) to photograph droplets directly in a cloud
(ref. 38) is based on fundamental principles and is basically a sound technique, 
but there are practical difficulties. Because of the high magnification 
required, the volume of the field of view is extremely small. As a
result, the average number of droplets per 8- by 10-inch picture is small in
clouds of moderate liquid-water contents. Therefore, a large number of pictures 
are required in order to obtain a size distribution. Since the magnification 
required is high, it is difficult to design a ca1Bera ao that the
object plane is outside the undisturbed airstream about an airplane or camera mount.

![Figure 35. NACA cloud camera.](/images%2FThe%20Icing%20Problem%2FFigure%2035.png)  

The oiled-slide technique, where a glass slide covered with a suitable
oil is exposed to a droplet-laden airstream and is then photographed through
a microscope, has been used also to determine droplet-size distributions.
This method yields photographs with a large number of droplets per picture
from which the droplet sizes may be measured. However, because of the relatively 
large size of the slide compared with the size of droplets, the overall 
collection efficiency and the local collection efficiencies of the slide
vary considerably with droplet size. The droplet-size distribution for any
given area of the slide must be corrected according to the local collection
efficiencies in order to obtain the true droplet-1i1e distribution of the
cloud. The local collection efficiencies used for thia correction are baaed
upon that of a ribbon in ideal two-dimensional flow. The exposure time required 
in order not to saturate the slide with droplets must be of the order
of a fraction of a second. This presents some difficulties, in that the
slide must be moved rapidly or a protective cover must be opened and closed
rapidly. This motion disturbs the airflow field in the vicinity of the
slide, and therefore the collection efficiencies of the slide are not the
same as for a ribbon in ideal flow.

An oil-stream aeroscope composed of five main parts (fig. 36) - droplet
pickup probe, circulating pumps for oil and air, photographic cell, light
source, and a photomicrographic camera - has been developed. The droplet
pickup probe consists of a small-diameter tube with a small hole on one
side. When operating, the probe is arranged so that the small hole faces
upstream to the air flow carrying the cloud droplets. Oil is forced by a
pump through the pickup probe in the direction indicated in the sketch. As
the oil passes the small hole, any water droplets that enter are trapped in
the oil. Oil does not flow out of the droplet pickup hole, because the oil
pressure is maintained at atmospheric pressure by the air pump shown in figure 36. 
The oil containing the droplets then flows through the transparent
plastic cell where the droplets are photographed with a photomicrographic
camera. The channel through the plastic cell narrows down at the point
where the pictures are taken, so that all the droplets are approximately in
the object plane of the camera. After leaving the plastic cell, the oil
passes through a filter and trap where the water droplets are removed. The
droplet size and distribution can then be determined by measuring the images
on the photographs from the known magnification. After the droplet distribution 
is known, the liquid-water content of the cloud can be calculated
from the known geometry of the instrument, the airspeed, and the oil-flow
rate. Limited data indicate that this instrument shows excellent promise
for obtaining the desired information.

The heated-wire instrument consists basically of a loop of resistance
wire (refs. 39 and 40) which is mounted in the airstream (fig. 37) and is
heated electrically by passing current through the wire. The wire diameter
is 0.021 to 0.064 inch, with a maximum power input of 31 to 300 watts, 
respectively (ref. 40). The change in wire resistance from the clear-air condition, 
resulting from cooling due to evaporation of impinging cloud water
droplets, is used as a measure of the liquid-water content, or icing severity. 
Although the heated-wire instrument has several disadvantages as
pointed out in reference 40, a workable instrument can be obtained that is
very useful in studying cloud microstructure.

A variation of the heated-wire instrument is currently under development 
at the NACA Lewis laboratory. This instrument consists of a heated
tube operating at constant surface temperature with a variable power input.
This instrument has the following advantage, over a constant-power heated-wire 
probe:

(1) The measured change in required power is linear with water impingement, 
because the surface temperature it fixed.  
(2) The change of heat-transfer coefficient under all conditions is
minimized.  
(3) The sensitivity to water impingement is maximized.  
(4) The power input is easily measured.  
(5) With proper design, the time constant is less than that of a wire
heated with constant power.  

While the control circuit for this probe has proved formidable, a satisfactory 
unit has been designed and operated. The probe is currently being calibrated 
in the Lewis icing tunnel.
