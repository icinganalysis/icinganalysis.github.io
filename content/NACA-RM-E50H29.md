## Abstract  

>An investigation was conducted to determine the electric power
requirements necessary for ice protection of inlet guide vanes by continuous 
heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show
the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air
velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements
for these two methods of ice protection.  
The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 inlet
guide vanes under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide 
a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for
continuous heating. Heat-on periods in the order of 10 seconds with a
cycle ratio of about 1:7 resulted in the best over-all performance with
respect to total power requirements and aerodynamic losses during the
heat-off period.  
Power requirements reported herein may be reduced by as much as
25 percent by achieving a more uniform surface-temperature distribution. 
A parameter in terma of engine mass flow, vane size, vane surface temperature, 
and the icing conditions ahead of the inlet guide
vanes was developed by which an extension of the experimental data to
icing conditions and inlet guide vanes, other than those investigated
was possible.

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
>The desirability for all-weather operation of turbojet aircraft
has necessitated extensive research on methods of icing protection for
the various engine components. Experience has shown that, in the
absence of a compressor-inlet screen, the inlet guide vanes of an
axial-flow turbojet engine constitute the most critical component to
be protected from icing. Ice formations on the inlet guide vanes
seriously affect engine performance by decreasing the compressor efficiency, 
by reducing the mass flow through the engine, and by causing
large pressure losses at the compressor inlet. These factors, which
reduce the net thrust, increase the specific fuel consumption, and
increase the tail-pipe temperatures beyond safe operation limits, can
render the engine inoperative in a matter of minutes in a heavy icing
condition.
> 
>Icing in the initial stages of compressor blading in current
engines is deemed of secondary importance to inlet-guide-vane icing
because icing occurs principally on the leading edges, where ice
formations are limited in size by mechanical abrasion due to the close
spacing and relative motion between the rotor- and the stator-blade
rows.  
> 
>Ice formations on inlet guide vanes tend to increase rapidly in
size at ambient-air temperatures above 10° F. In the temperature
range of 10° to 32° F, the ice formations at the leading and the
trailing edges tend to mushroom and if the vanes are closely spaced,
bridging of the ice formations between adjacent vanes occurs. By use
of larger size inlet guide vanes with a greater spacing between vanes,
ice bridging between adjacent vanes can be considerably delayed and
the icing tolerance of the engine increased. The icing protection of
inlet guide vanes may be accomplished by heating the surface of the
vanes either by use of hot gas or by electrical means.  
> 
>An investigation at the NACA Levis laboratory to determine the
electric power requirements for inlet-guide-vane icing protection was
conducted on vanes that were twice the size of vanes in current production 
engines. The increased size was required to provide for
adequate instrumentation and is in accordance with current design
trends. The investigation was made over a range of icing conditions
to determine the minimum electric power requirements for icing protection 
by continuous heating of the inlet guide vanes. In addition,
cyclical de-icing studies were made to determine the possible saving
in total power by this system of ice protection over the power required
for continuous heating. An analysis is included to extend the experimental 
results to vane sizes and icing conditions other than those
studied.

>APPARATUS AND INSTRUMENTATION  
> 
>The electrically heated guide vane was the center vane of a cascade
of five vanes mounted in a special housing in the 6- by 9-foot test section 
of the icing research tunnel (fig. 1). The walls of the housing
end the two guide vanes at each side of the center vane were hollow and
gas-heated to prevent icing. The air flow through the housing was regulated 
by remotely controlled flaps at the exit of the housing.  

![Figure 1. Inlet-guide-vane installation in Icing reeearch tunnel.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50H29%2FFigure%201.png)  

>Each vane had a chord of 2.37 inches and a total span of 6.12
inches, of which 5.90 Inches were exposed between the upper and lover
walls of the housing. The spacing between vanes was 3.12 inches. Only
the electrically heated vane was aluminum with heating elements and
guide tubes for thermocouples cast in place. The heating element consisted 
of Nichrome wire encased in glass-cloth insulation and covered
with a copper sheath; the element was in the shape of a hairpin so that
both ends emerged from the top of the vane. Four heater circuits were
used in the vane investigated and were spaced as shown in figure 2.
Each circuit was independently connected to a variable transformer,
which permitted selective power input to the four circuits. Power input
to the various circuits was measured with a recording wattmeter. An
electronic timer was used. to regulate the heat-on and heat-off periods
for the cyclical de-icing studies. Stainless-steel pilot tubes were
positioned in the vane at the time of casting so that thermocouple wires
could be inserted. Iron-constantan thermocouples were used and the
junction peened flush with the vane surface. The thermocouples were
positioned in a chordwise plane (fig. 2) 3 inches from the top of the
vane.

![Figure 2. Construction details of electrically heated inlet guide vane showing
location of heater circuits and. surface thermocouples.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50H29%2FFigure%202.png)  

Note the "iron-constantan thermocouples were used and the
junction peened flush with the vane surface". 
The peening 
(sometimes perform using the ball-peen end of a hammer, 
other times with metal shot propelled like sand-blasting) 
ensures that the thermocouple is encased in the metal surface 
where the temperature is intended to be read. 
I have seen large thermocouple errors with other installation methods
(particularly using adhesives, including "thermally conductive" adhesives) 
where the reported temperature is obviously not the actual surface temperature.  

>Wet-air heat-transfer evaluation. - In order to obtain an understanding 
of the heat-transfer mechanism for icing conditions, 
analysis was made to determine the wet-air heat-transfer coefficients
HX+M in terms of local power densities. The analysis used to obtain
these coefficients makes use of, the wet-air analysis presented in
reference 2. 

>The heat loss from the inlet guide vane caused by evaporation was
calculated using Hardy's evaporation factor as given in reference 4.
The full evaporation factor was used on all surfaces subject to direct
water impingement as indicated by the
values in figure 6(b).  

![Figure 6. - Calculated variation of local water-impingement efficiency over inlet-guide-vane surface.

>Beyond the limit of water impingement on the convex surface, runback
was assumed to occur and, based on experimental observations of airfoil 
sections, an average value of 20 percent of the full evaporation
factor was assumed. As in the dry-air analysis, the vane-surface temperatures 
were maintained as uniform as possible at the minimum total
power required to prevent icing. The surface temperatures for two
typical cases analyzed are shown. In figure 7. The icing conditions for
these temperature distributions were: air velocities of 401 and 261 feet
per second, ambient-alr temperatures of -12° and -5° F, liquid-water
contents of 0.58 and 0.62 gram per cubic meter, and average experimental 
power densities of 9.3 and 6.4 watts per square inch, respectively.

Liquid-water content, approximately 0.6 gram per cubic meter.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E50H29%2FFigure%207.png)

>The same boundary-layer conditions as for the dry-air analysis
were initially assumed. Calculations of the local power density as a
function of the surface distance were then made (fig. 7) for the icing
conditions previously stated. Integration, of the area under the curves
shown in figure 7 indicated lover total power inputs for icing protection 
of the vane than were experimentally obtained. The boundary layer
assumed on the concave surface was therefore changed to Include a
turbulent boundary layer over the rearward portion of the inlet guide
vane as shown in figure 7. By an adjustment of the amount of vane
area assumed to be in the turbulent-flow region, the calculated average
value of power density or average wet-air heat-transfer coefficient
could be calculated to approach the experimentally obtained average
value. The validity of the assumption of a partially turbulent boundary
layer on the concave surface has been substantiated In reference 2 and
at the Lewis laboratory by unpublished experimental studies of heat
transfer from an airfoil in icing conditions, which indicate that a
water film on the surface of an airfoil section causes early transition
from laminar to turbulent flow.

>With
respect to cyclical de-icing, a short heat-off period of about 60 seconds 
therefore appears to be more desirable than longer periods in
the order of 120 seconds. Photographs of typical ice formations on an
inlet guide vane are shown in figure 20 for an air velocity of 400 feet.
per second. The icing conditions for the ice formations shown in these
photographs were a liquid-water content ranging from 0.4 to 0.85 gram
per cubic meter with ambient-air temperatures ranging from 310 to
100 F. The large ice formations on the leading and trailing edges for
the 120-second icing period were similar to those causing the large
pressure losses shown in figure 19. These losses were primarily
caused by the reduction in the free flow area by the ice formations
between adjacent vanes.

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
From a study of the electric power requirements necessary for ice
protection of inlet guide vanes by continuous heating and by cyclical
de-icing, the following results were obtained:  
>1. The average power requirement per inlet guide vane per cycle is
in the order of 79 percent less than that required for continuous heat-
ing under the same conditions: namely, air velocity ahead of the vane,
400 feet per second; ambient-air temperature, _1l0 F; liquid-water
content, approximately 0.6 gram per cubic meter; heat-on time, 10 sec-
onds; and. cycle ratio 1:7.  
>2. Cycle periods of 10 or less seconds heat-on and 60 seconds.
heat-off result in the best over-all performance with respect to total
power input required. for icing protection and aerodynamic losses during
the heat-off period.  
>3. For conditions similar to those given in the first result, the
electric power requirements for a hypothetical engine utilizing continuous 
heating for the 28 inlet guide vanes with a total vane area of
865 square inches was 7800 watts (9.0 watts/sq in.), whereas under
the same conditions cyclical de-icing require4 only 1650 watts. Because
a uniform surface temperature could not be fully attained on the Inlet
guide vane investigated, the continuous requirement is approximately
25 percent higher than would be required for a uniform surface temperature of 32° F.  
>4. A parameter was developed in terms of the engine mass flow,
vane size, ambient pressure and temperature ahead of the inlet, guide
vanes, surface temperature, and liquid-water content that permits a
determination of power requirements for ice prevention beyond the
limits of the experimental studies. The experimental values of power
required for Ice prevention of inlet guide vanes coincide closely with
values calculated using this parameter.
