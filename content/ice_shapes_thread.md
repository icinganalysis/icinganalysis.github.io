Title: Ice Shapes and Their Effects  
Category: NACA  

###_"an irregular shape is developed due to the ice formation, which is ruinous to the aerodynamic efficiency of the airfoils"_ [^1]

#Ice Shapes and Their Effects Thread

This thread will cover ice shapes and the aerodynamic effects of the ice.

This will primarily cover ice shapes on unprotected surfaces.

There are additional publications on ice shapes for deicing systems and propellers that will not be reviewed here.
