### _"The situation changed in the mid-1920s when the intrepid aviators of the U.S. Air Mail Service attempted to maintain scheduled day-and-night operations between New York and Chicago... As one of their pilots noted at the time about the hazards of the New York-Chicago route, “the greatest of all our problems is ice.”" [^1]_

## Summary  

I have an email list of those who would like to receive notice of the latest posts 
and other site-related news. 
<!--email_off-->
An advantage of the email notification is early notifications of new posts. 
To enroll, email <a "href="mailto:BlastFromThePastEmailList@proton.me">BlastFromThePastEmailList@proton.me</a> 
with "enroll" in the subject line. There is no charge to enroll. 
<!--/email_off-->
Another advantage of enrolling in the mailing list is access to the secret* blog drafts that are in-work, 
before the public sees them.

[* Well, not so secret if one is acquainted with github.]

Email will be sent out by BCC mailing, to maintain your privacy. 
However, if you reply to an email, then others can see your email address. 

To keep the size manageable, I am limiting this signup window to 50 new subscriptions 
(there may be additional signup windows in the future). 
If it grows much, I may have to move to a newsletter service provider. 

If there is abusive of the list (such as reply to all with spam, uncivil comments, 
excessive self-promotion [save that for social media, where it is expected], etc.) I will remove yor from the list. 
Also, human only accounts, please. If I identify a bot account, I will remove it.

To unsubscribe, send an email with "unsubscribe" in the subject line.  

Typical publishing time-line:  

- email list subscribers may view drafts  
- post at [icinganalysis.github.io](https://icinganalysis.github.io) and [icinganalysis.com](https://icinganalysis.com) (mirrored sites) (simultaneous [RSS](https://icinganalysis.com/feeds/all.rss.xml) update)  
- email notifications  
- post notice at mastodon [historians.social/@icinganalysis](https://historians.social/@icinganalysis)  
- post notice on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-cook-96204316a/)  

## Sample email content  

```text
Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" email list!
"Blast from the Past" reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

Latest post: Site Improvements https://icinganalysis.com/site-improvements.html

What is in work:

Porter Perkins thread draft <<link for subscribers only>>

Interesting find: A commenter on LinkedIn pointed me to Kelley Johnson's 1940 "Wing Loading, Icing and Associated Aspects of Modern Transport Design"
https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.10478. I might add this to the Ice Shapes and Their Effects thread on the blog.

Most popular posts (so far...):

#6: NACA-TN-313, "The Formation of Ice upon Airplanes in Flight" https://icinganalysis.com/naca-tn-313.html
One of the earliest publications I have reviewed (1929), with eye-catching sketches and a great quote.
(more popular posts in the next newsletter)

Upcoming posts:

The reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).
(You can find them at [Latest Posts](https://icinganalysis.com/archives.html) if you cannot wait)
9/29: A Detailed Comparison of Water Drop Impingement Calculations
10/2: Implementation of multicylinder calculations in Python
10/4: NACA-TN-1393, “A Flight Investigation of the Meteorological Conditions Conducive to the Formation of Ice on Airplanes"

Upcoming Aircraft Icing Events:

Public Domain image of the week:

#AltText : Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904. Water-drop-trajectory analog.
Two investigators operate a large mechanical computer.
One is seated turning a crank attached to a large cylinder labeled "Input Chart".
The second operator turns another input chart crank.
Another cylinder is labeled "Droplet Trajectories".
There are many shafts and gears visible in the machine.
Some machine parts are labeled with the differential equations of motion being solved.
