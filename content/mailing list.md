## Discussion  

I have a mail list of those who would like to receive notice of the latest posts 
and other site-related news. Another advantage of enrolling in the mailing list is access to the secret* blog drafts that are in-work, 
before the public sees them.

[* Well, not so secret if one is acquainted with github.]

Typical publishing time-line:  

- email list subscribers may view drafts  
- post at [icinganalysis.github.io](https://icinganalysis.github.io) and [icinganalysis.com](https://icinganalysis.com) (mirrored sites) (simultaneous [RSS](https://icinganalysis.com/feeds/all.rss.xml) update)  
- email notifications  
- post notice at mastodon [historians.social/@icinganalysis](https://historians.social/@icinganalysis)  
- post notice on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-cook-96204316a/)

Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.
- Latest post:
Site Improvements https://icinganalysis.com/site-improvements.html
- What is in work:
Porter Perkins thread draft
<<link for subscribers only>>
- Interesting finds:
A commenter on LinkedIn pointed me to Kelley Johnson's 1940 "Wing Loading, Icing and Associated Aspects of Modern Transport Design" https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.10478. I might add this to the Ice Shapes and Their Effects thread on the blog.
- Most popular posts (so far...):
#6: NACA-TN-313, "The Formation of Ice upon Airplanes in Flight" https://icinganalysis.com/naca-tn-313.html
One of the earliest publications I have reviewed, with eye-catching sketches and a great quote.
- Upcoming posts:
The reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn). 
9/29: A Detailed Comparison of Water Drop Impingement Calculations 
10/2: Implementation of multicylinder calculations in Python 
10/4: NACA-TN-1393, “A Flight Investigation of the Meteorological Conditions Conducive to the Formation of Ice on Airplanes"
- Quote of the week: 'The situation changed in the mid-1920s when the intrepid aviators of the U.S. Air Mail Service attempted to maintain scheduled day-and-night operations between New York and Chicago... As one of their pilots noted at the time about the hazards of the New York-Chicago route, “the greatest of all our problems is ice.”'
