## Abstract  
 
> Vibration and icing determinations on a CAA type V-109 very- 
high-frequency aircraft antenna were conducted in the NACA Lewis 
icing research tunnel. The antenna is an omnidirectional-range unit 
that consists of two aluminum elements mounted in a streamline 
plastic head forming a V in plan view with an apex angle of 80°.
> 
> Vibration determinations during a nonicing experiment produced 
element-tip total amplitude of approximately 1/4 inch at a tunnel-air 
velocity of 300 miles per hour.
> 
> During the icing investigation, a total amplitude as great as 
7 inches was observed at the antenna-element tips with tunnel-air 
velocities greater than 160 miles per hour and a tunnel-air temperature 
of 20° F. At the higher tunnel-air temperatures, which produced a 
heavier and more severe ice accretion, the damping effect of 
the ice reduced the element-tip amplitudes over the entire range of 
tunnel-air velocities to a maximum of 1/4 inch at a tunnel-air 
velocity of 300 miles per hour.

>INTRODUCTION
> 
> After experiments with numerous types of directional-range aircraft 
antenna, the CAA V-109 very-high-frequency antenna was
found by the Civil Aeronautics Administration to have improved
receiving characteristics when compared with other types of antenna
investigated. The CAA V-109 antenna was developed to replace those
now being used for four-course low-frequency ranges.
> 
> Aerodynamic and icing investigations of the V-109 aircraft
antenna. were conducted in the icing research tunnel of the NACA
Lewis laboratory at the request of the Civil Aeronautics Administration 
to determine the flutter or vibration tendencies of the
antenna elements under normal flight conditions and the effect of
ice formations on the vibration of the antenna.
> 
> APPARATUS
> 
> The CAA V-109 very-high-frequency aircraft antenna was
installed in the 6- by 9-foot test section of the icing research
tunnel. A bank of spray nozzles was located upstream of the model
to simulate icing conditions.
> 
> Each of the antenna elements is made of streamlined aluminum
tubing 24-7/8 inches long having a chord of approximately 7/8 inch.
The elements are secured in a streamlined laminated plastic head
and element cap forming a simple V plan form with an apex angle
of 80°. This assembly is mounted on a streamlined aluminum pedestal 
18 inches high. Steel inserts approximately 8 inches long
are provided adjacent to the head in each of the elements to add
strength to the joints. A second antenna used after failure of the
first model was the same as the original model except that the element 
head and cap were made of a transparent solid plastic.
> 
> CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURE
> 
> A vibration investigation was conducted without icing at
tunnel-air velocities of 100, 200, and 300 miles per hour. Icing
experiments were conducted at tunnel-air velocities of 100, 160,
and 250 miles per hour, and tunnel-air temperatures from 0° to
28° F. The simulated icing cloud for the investigation contained
droplets with a mean effective diameter of approximately 11 microns
and a liquid-water content of approximately 1.5 grams per cubic
meter at a tunnel-air velocity of 100 miles per hour, 0.95 gram
per cubic meter at 160 miles per hour, and 0.60 gram per cubic
meter at 250 miles per hour. The icing severity and the amplitude
of vibration at the tip of the antenna elements were visually
determined.
> 
> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
> 
> The antenna under icing and nonicing conditions is shown in
figure 1.

>During the nonicing vibration experiments at tunnel-air velocities 
of 100, 200, and 300 miles per hour, the amplitude of vibration 
at the antenna-element tips steadily increased as the tunnel-air 
velocity increased. An amplitude of approximately 1/4 inch was
reached at the element tip at a tunnel-air velocity of 300 miles
per hour with a periodic surge of approximately 1/2-inch amplitude.
The first part of the icing investigation was conducted at a
tunnel-air velocity of 100 miles per hour and a tunnel-air temperature 
of 16° F. Vibration of the antenna elements began immediately
after even very small amounts of ice began to form and reached a
maximum total amplitude of approximately 2 inches within 1-1/2 minutes.
The antenna after 20 minutes of icing is shown in figure 1(b). At
a tunnel-air velocity of 160 miles per hour and a tunnel-air temperature 
of 20° F, vibration became progressively worse during icing
until a total amplitude as great as 6 inches at the element tips
was observed within 8 minutes of icing (fig. 1(c)). When the tunnel-
air velocity was increased to 250 miles per hour with a tunnel-air
temperature of 20° F, the total amplitude was observed to reach
approximately 6 inches during the first 3 minutes of icing. Further
icing for an additional 4 minutes had little or no effect on the
amplitude, which stabilized at approximately 7 inches. After 7 minutes 
of icing, however, one antenna element experienced a vibratory
failure at the end point of the steel insert (figs. 1(d) and 2).

>A duplicate investigation was made with a second antenna. having
a transparent plastic head to compare its behavior with that of the
first antenna. For a nonicing condition, the vibration of the elements 
was of the same magnitude as for the original. The antenna
was subjected to more severe icing at a tunnel-air velocity of
160 miles per hour and a tunnel-air temperature of 28° F. An
element-tip amplitude of approximately 6 inches was reached after
4 minutes of icing, but, after 5 minutes of icing, the ice accretion 
on the antenna elements became so heavy that the damping
effect reduced the amplitude to approximately 1/4 inch and further
icing for a total of 7 minutes (fig. 1(e)) had no additional effect.
Observations were made at 250 and 300 miles per hour with a
very heavy ice accretion obtained at 160 miles per hour and 26° F
for 15 minutes. The elements with part of the ice shed from the
inner sections are shown in figure 1(f). The subsequent observations
made at 250 and 300 miles per hour without further icing indicated
that vibration (maximum, 1/4 in.) was not serious at these speeds
with heavy icing.
> 
> At a tunnel-air temperature of 0° F and a tunnel-air velocity 
of 250 miles per hour, icing was much less severe aerodynamically 
(fig. 1(g)) and the element-tip vibration amplitude reached 
approximately 4 inches after 5 minutes of icing.

## Conclusions  

>The following results were obtained from an icing and vibration 
investigation conducted in the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel 
using a CAA V-109 very-high-frequency aircraft antenna:  
>1. During the nonicing vibration investigation at tunnel-air
velocities of 100, 200, and 300 miles per hour, the element-tip
amplitudes increased in proportion with the velocities and reached
a maximum total amplitude of 1/4 inch at a tunnel-air velocity of
300 miles per hour. A surge of approximately 1/2-inch amplitude
occurred periodically at a tunnel-air velocity of 300 miles per
hour.  
>2. At a tunnel-air velocity of 100 miles per hour and a tunnel-air 
temperature of 16° F, total tip amplitudes of not more than
2 inches were observed during a 20-minute icing period. For tunnel-air 
velocities above 160 miles per hour, vibration amplitudes of
7 inches were realized for icing conditions of a-minute duration or
leas. The tunnel-air temperature was maintained at 20° F.  
>3. Failure of an antenna element occurred after a 7-minute
icing period at a tunnel-air velocity of 250 miles per hour and a
tunnel-air temperature of 20° F. At the time of failure, tip
amplitudes of approximately 7 inches were observed.  
>4. With more severe icing accumulations, where ice occurred at
a tunnel-air temperature of 26° F, the damping effect of the ice at
300 miles per hour reduced the element-tip amplitudes to a maximum
of 1/4 inch.
