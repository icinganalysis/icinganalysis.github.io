> A method is given for calculating the temperature of a
surface wetted either by a pure liquid, such as water, or by
a mixture, such as alcohol and water.
The method is applied
to the problem of protecting, by alcohol, propellers and the
induction system of the engine against ice. The minimum
quantity of alcohol required is calculated for a number of 
arbitrarily chosen conditions. The effect of evaporation of 
alcohol is shown repeating the calculations for a nonvolatile
fluid. The method can be applied to other problems in evaporation,
for instance, to the evaporation of fuel in the
induction system of the engine. 
The psychometric equations, 
used in wet-bulb hygrometry, is deduced in its general form.
The effect of kinetic heating is included.
