## Abstract  

>A flight investigation was made to determine the effect of
distance flown in the icing region, antenna length, and antenna
angle on the tension occurring in aircraft antennae while in
regions of aircraft icing.  
> 
> The, experimental antennas were of lengths ranging from 15 to
43 feet and were placed at angles of 0° to 64° with the airplane
thrust axis. Distances up to 256 miles were flown in diverse
icing conditions at true airspeeds from 157 to 214 miles per hour
and pressure altitudes at which icing conditions were encountered.  
> 
> The results indicate that: The effect of ice formation on
antenna tension increased with the angle of the antennas with the
longitudinal axis of the airplane. The maximum tension for
antennae having angles from 0° to 15° was 68 pounds, whereas the
maximum tension for antennas having angles of 44° and 64° was
274 and 438 pounds, respectively.

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
> The current use of improved airplane ice-prevention equipment 
has extended operations in icing conditions and thus accentuated 
the need for protecting aircraft antennas against structural
failures resulting from ice accretions. A flight investigation
was therefore conducted at the NACA Cleveland laboratory to determine 
the tension in aircraft antennas produced by ice formations.  
> 
> The investigation was conducted in natural Icing conditions
over a range of true airspeeds from 157 to 214 miles per hour and
altitudes from 3500 to 9500 feet. Seven experimental antennas of
lengths ranging from 15 to 43 feet were placed at angles of 0° to
64° with the thrust axis of the airplane. The effect of the
following factors on the antenna tension was Investigated: antenna
length, included angle between the antenna and the thrust axis of
the airplane, and distance flown in the icing region.
> 
> APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE
The location of the seven experimental antennas on the airplane
is shown in figure 1...

![Figure 1. Location of experimental antennas on airplane and angle and length of antennas.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E7H26a%2FFigure%201.png)  

> Inasmuch as it was anticipated that the tension which would be
imposed on the antennas would exceed the breaking strength of the
ordinary antenna wire, the experimental antennae used were of
1/16-inch diameter, 7 by 7, aircraft-control cable. Turnbuckles
and spring-tension units were mounted on the rear of the antennas
(fig. 2) In order to impose a static tension of 30 pounds.  

![Figure 2. Turnbuckle and spring-tension unit mounted on rear of experimental antenna.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E7H26a%2FFigure%202.png)  

> The tension In the antennas was measured by strain gages
located at the front of the antennas (fig. 3). The strain gages
were temperature-compensating and were sealed In order to keep
them moisture-free. Electrically heated anti-icing boots were
installed, around the body of the strain gages. A recording
galvanometer indicated, the tension in the antennas. The strain-gage 
system was accurate to ±2 percent.

>Multirotating cylinders, as shown in figure 4, were used to
determine the average droplet diameter, the drop-size distribution,
and the liquid-water content. These cylinders were similar to
those used in reference 1 with minor mechanical modifications.
Pressure altitude and indicated airspeed were measured by service
instruments and the ambient-air temperature was measured by a
shielded resistance-bulb thermometer.

> A series of four flights was conducted. Into areas of predicted icing. 
Table I presents the meteorological conditions for
the respective flights. The values shown in this table are the
averages of Individual values recorded at intervals throughout
each flight operation. The notation for the drop-size distribution
corresponds to that given in reference 1, table I, page 6. The
factors that made possible the existence and the suspension of
supercooled. liquid-water droplets encountered during the flight
operations are presented in the appendix.

> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
> 
> Photographs of ice configurations on the 8°, 41-foot antenna
and the 15°, 32-foot antenna are presented in figures 5 and 6,
respectively, and are representative of Ice formations on antennas
having angles from 0° to 15°.

![Figure 6. Typical ice formation collected on 15°, 32-foot antenna during flight. View looking aft.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E7H26a%2FFigure%206.png)  

>Figure 7 is a photograph, taken in
flight, of the ice formation on the 15°, 32-foot antenna and the
64°, 40-foot antenna. The, ice configuration on the 64°, 40-foot
antenna is illustrative of configurations collected on the 64°,
40-foot and the 44°, 42-foot antennas during, most of the flight
operations.

>The variation of antenna tension with distance flown in the
icing region for the antennas is presented in figure 8 for the
four flight operations. The shaded areas on the figures for the
64°, 40-foot and 44°, 42-foot antennas represent the maximum and
minimum tensions produced by whipping. The variation of antenna
tension due to whipping for the 0° and 15° antennas was insignificant. 
Figure 8 shows that, in general, for the 44° and 64° antennas,
antenna tension increases considerably with the distance flown In
the icing region; whereas, for the antennas of 15° and less, the
variation of tension with distance is insignificant. The change in
the slope of the antenna-tension curve from positive to negative
indicates that whipping of the antennas broke office formations
and thereby temporarily reduced the antenna tension.

>The variation of antenna tension with antenna angle for
antennas of approximately 42 feet in length is presented in figure 9. 
The tension values presented in this figure were obtained
from figure 8. Figure 9 indicates that the antenna tension
increased with increasing antenna angle for antennas of nearly constant 
length. With increasing angle, the antenna tension increased
eight times faster in the 44° to 64° range than in the 0° to
15° range. The slope of the curve for antenna angles greater than
15° indicates that the required antenna strength increases rapidly
as the antenna angle is increased beyond 15°. The investigation
presented in reference 2 also recommends a limiting antenna angle
of 15°. The variation of antenna tension with antenna length
at a constant antenna angle of 15° is presented in figure 10. The
data were obtained from figure 8 and indicate that the tension
increases nearly linearly with antenna length. The maximum-ten-
sion measured for each of the seven experimental antennas during
the four flight operations is given in table II.

## Conclusions  

>From an analysis of the tension occurring in aircraft antennas
during flights in regions of aircraft icing made for antennae with
angles to the thrust axis of the airplane of 0°, 8°, 15°, 44°, and
64° and lengths from 15 to 43 feet, the following results were
obtained:  
>1. The tension in the 440 and 640 antennas increased considerably 
with distance flown In the icing region, whereas the tension
for antenna angles of 15° and-less did not increase appreciably
with distance flown in the icing condition.  
>2. The rate of change of antenna tension with antenna angle
in the 0° to 15° range was one-eighth the rate of change of
antenna tension with antenna angle In the 44° to 64° range. The
slope of the curves of tension as a function of antenna angle
begins to change appreciably above 15°, which indicates that the
required strength of antennas will increase rapidly if the antenna
angle is increased beyond 15°.  
>3. Antenna tension varied approximately linearly with antenna
length.  
>4. The maximum recorded tension for the 0° to 15° antennas
was 68 pounds. The maximum tension for the 44° and 64° antennas
was 274 and 438 pounds, respectively.
