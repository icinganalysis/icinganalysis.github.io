The image was generated with [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) with the prompt 
"An airplane from 1946 flying with engine exhaust heat ice protection". 
I have no idea what the orange thing (ribbon and bow?) is on the wing.   

I also tried letting [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) write a blog post.  

Prompt: "Write a blog post about the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection during the era of the National Advisory Committee for Aerodynamics, including citations"  

Response:  

>The National Advisory Committee for Aerodynamics (NACA) was a organization in the United States that existed from 1915 to 1958. During its existence, NACA carried out research on various aspects of aerodynamics, including the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection.  
>
>One of the early NACA reports on this topic, "Investigation of the Feasibility of Utilizing Engine Exhaust Heat for Ice Protection," was published in 1945. The report described experiments in which heat from the exhaust of a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine was directed onto the leading edge of a wing using a special duct. The results of the experiments showed that the exhaust heat was effective in preventing ice from forming on the wing surface.  
>
>Another NACA report, "Investigation of the Feasibility of Utilizing Engine Exhaust Heat for Ice Protection on a Full-Scale Airplane," was published in 1946. This report described tests conducted on a Douglas C-54 airplane in which heat from the engines was directed onto the wing leading edges and the propellers. The results of the tests showed that the exhaust heat was effective in preventing ice from forming on the wing and propeller surfaces.  
>
>NACA's research on the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection was significant because it demonstrated that this method was a viable means of preventing ice from forming on the surfaces of aircraft. This was important because ice can form on aircraft surfaces during flight, which can reduce lift and increase drag, making the aircraft more difficult to control.  
>
>In conclusion, NACA had conducted research on the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection during its era, and the results of their research showed that it was a viable means of preventing ice from forming on the surfaces of aircraft. The research done by the NACA was significant as it helped pave the way for the use of this technology in modern aircraft.

>>NACA, "Investigation of the Feasibility of Utilizing Engine Exhaust Heat for Ice Protection," Technical Report No. 919 (1945).  
>>NACA, "Investigation of the Feasibility of Utilizing Engine Exhaust Heat for Ice Protection on a Full-Scale Airplane," Technical Report No. 944 (1946).   
 
The titles for the citations are not correct. I could not find NACA publications with those titles. 
There is a NACA-TR-919, but the correct title is ["Accuracy of airspeed measurements and flight calibration procedures"](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search?q=NACA-TR-919), 
and for NACA-TR-944 the title should be ["Analysis of spanwise temperature distribution in three types of air-cooled turbine blade"](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search?q=NACA-TR-994), 
neither of which are about ice protection.   

NACA (Langley) did have a [C-54 test airplane during this time](https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/app-e.htm), 
but I could not find anything about it being used for icing research. 

At least it got the dates for NACA correct.  

I hope that my typical post is at least a little better than this.
