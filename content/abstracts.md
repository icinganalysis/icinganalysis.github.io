## Introduction  
 
The 1981 reprint of ["Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md) [^1] 
included abstracts of the 132 references in 17 categories.  

Unfortunately, the online version available has rather poor image quality. 
A notation is included:

In some areas, the text is barely legible. 
I believe that this has hampered awareness about and use of this important publication. 

Here, the text is reformatted and presented here in html format, 
which is both human- and machine-readable.  

The formats vary in the original text. 
Some match what is in the publications, and 
others are briefer summaries typically found on library reference cards. 
No effort was made here to make them more uniform in style
(for example, some titles are in ALL CAPS, and others are not). 
The abstracts may differ from those that you may find in listings at [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/).  

The numbering from the 1981 publication is used here. 
A later republication (in AC 20-73) used consecutive numbering 
within a category, but not for the entire publication.  

Several text extractions techniques were used, but all of them had some errors. 
Errors found were corrected manually, but there still may be errors.

A PROBABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS CONDUCTIVE TO AIRCRAFT ICING IN THE UNITED STATES.  
William Lewis and Norman R. Bergrun. June 1952. 93p. diagrs., 11 tabs. (NACA TN 2738)  
Meteorological icing data obtained in flight in the United States are analyzed statistically and methods are developed for the determination of (1) the various simultaneous combinations of the three basic icing parameters (liquid-water content, drop diameter, and temperature) which would have equal probability of being exceeded in flight in any random icing encounter, and (2) the probability of exceeding any specified group of values of liquid-water content associated simultaneously with temperature and drop-diameter values lying within specified ranges.
method provides a convenient means of calculating the percentage of icing encounters in which the water collection rate exceeds the design rate.

A SUMMARY OF METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT ICING AND A PROPOSED METHOD OF SELECTING DESIGN CRITERIONS FOR ICE-PROTECTION EQUIPMENT  
Paul T. Hacker and Robert G. Dorsch. November 1951. 35p. diagrs. (NACA TN 2569)  
Data on the meteorological parameters pertinent to the aircraft icing problem are so summarized as to give the frequency of occurrence of observed icing situations according to two of the parameters. The summarized data indicate that statistical relations exist between some of the parameters. A method, based upon the collection efficiency of an airfoil and the frequency of occurrence of icing situations with various liquid-water contents and mean-effective droplet sizes, is proposed for the selection of design criterions for ice-protection equipment.

RECOMMENCED VALUES OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE DESIGN OF AIRCRAFT ICE-PREVENTION EQUIPMENT  
By Alun B. Jones and William Lewis  
SUMMARY  
Meteorological conditions conducive to aircraft icing are arranged in four classifications: three are associated with cloud structure and the fourth with freezing rain. The range of possible meteorological factors for each classification is discussed and specific values recommended for consideration in the design of ice-prevention equipment for aircraft are selected and tabulated. The values selected are based upon a study of the available observational data and theoretical considerations where observations are lacking. Recommendations for future research in the field are presented.

Investigation of Meteorological Conditions Associated with Aircraft Icing in Layer-Type Clouds for 1947-48 Winter.  
By Dwight B. Kline  
NACA TN 1793 January 1949  
Abstract  
Measurements of liquid-vater content, drop size, and temperature during icing conditions encountered in flight are shown to be consistent with previously measured conditions and with proposed maximum icing conditions in supercooled layer-type clouds. Cumulative-frequency graphs of meteorological parameters are presented indicating the frequency with which various icing conditions have been encountered in the Great Lakes ares and surrounding states during two winters of flight observations.

Meteorological Analysis of Icing Conditions Encountered in Low-Altitude Stratiform Clouds.  
By Dwight B. Kline and Joseph A. Walker  
NACA TN 2506 March 1951  
Abstract  
Liquid-water content, droplet size, and temperature data measured in predominantly stratiform clouds during the 1948-49 and 1949-50 winters are presented. The horizontal and vertical extent of icing conditions and the relation of the existence of supercooled clouds to cyclone areas and precipitation regions are indicated. Liquid-water content measurements during 12 flights are shown in relation to theoretical amounts calculated from radiosonde data and cloud depth observations.

ICING PROPERTIES OF NONCYCLONIC WINTER STRATUS CLOUDS  
By William Lewis, U.S. Weather Bureau  
SUMMARY  
Measurements of the vertical distribution of liquid water concentration and drop size have been made in winter stratus clouds in the absence of significant cyclonic or frontal activity. 
The observations indicate that the clouds are formed by turbulent mixing of the lower layers of the atmosphere, resulting in a region of constant specific humidity and adiabatic lapse rates. 
Calculations based on these characteristics were used to construct a graph which give the liquid water concentration in terms of temperature at the cloud base and the height above the base. 
In clouds from which no snow was falling, the measured values were in good agreement with those given by the graph. 
Snowfall was found to deplete the liquid water content especially in the lower part of the eloud layer, causing dissipation of the cloud from the base upwards.

Observations of Icing Conditions Encountered in Flight During 1948.  
By William Lewis and Walter H. Hoecker, Jr.  
NACA TN 1904 June 1949  
Abstract  
Meteorological data from 40 flights in icing conditions are presented. The report also includes a discussion of the relation between the horizontal extent of icing conditions and the average liquid-water content observed therein, the reliability of flight measurements of drop-size distribution, and an apparent geographical influence upon the size of cloud drops.

A Further Investigation of the Meteorological Conditions Conducive to Aircraft Icing  
By William Lewis, Dwight B. Kline, and Charles P. Steinmetz  
NACA TN No. 1424 October, 1947  
Abstract  
Data from flight observations in icing conditions am liquid water content, temperature, and mean-effective drop diameter are shown to be consistent with previously proposed values. Data on drop-size distribution with the rotating-cylinder method, although consistent with previous data, were inconsistent with data derived from stationary cylinder investigations. The relation between temperature and maximum water content in layer clouds is iscussed and estimates are given for the highest values of water to be expected in layer clouds at various temperatures.

PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF ICING CONDITIONS MEASURED DURING ROUTINE TRANSCONTINENTAL AIRLINE OPERATION.  
Porter J. Perkins. December 1952. 27p. diagra., photos., 3 tabs. (NACA RM E52J06)  
Icing data collected on routine operations by four DC-4-type transport aircraft equipped with NACA pressure-type icing-rate meters and flying over a transcontinental route from January through May 1951 are presented. The four aircraft were in icing conditions approximately 1-1/2 percent of the total flying time. Nearly one-half of the icing conditions were encountered over the Great Lakes area.  
Average liquid-water-content measurements did not exceed 1.0 gram per cubic meter and 80 percent of the measurements did not exceed 0.4 gram per cubic meter. The data are considered only preliminary and the program is continuing to provide additional data from world-wide air routes.

STATISTICAL SURVEY OF ICING DATA MEASURED ON SCHEDULED AIRLINE FLIGHTS OVER THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA FROM NOVEMBER 1951 TO JUNE 1952.  
Porter J. Perkins. September 1955. 44p. diagra., photos., 2 tabs. (NACA RM E55F28a)  
A statistical survey and a preliminary analysis are made in an interim report of over 600 icing encounters obtained from a continuing program sponsored by the NACA with the cooperation of the airlines. Pressure-type icing-rate meters were installed on 11 airline aircraft of various types. Icing conditions measured during scheduled operations gave relative frequencies of liquid-water content, icing rate, total ice accumulations, cloud temperatures, as well as horizontal and vertical extent of icing clouds. Liquid-water contents were higher than data from earlier research flights in layer-type clouds but slightly lower than previous data from cumulus clouds.

ICING FREQUENCIES EXPERIENCED DURING CLIMB AND DESCENT BY FIGHTER-INTERCEPTOR AIRCRAFT.  
Porter J. Perkins. July 1958. 30p. diagrs., tabs. (NACA TN 4314)  
Relative frequencies of occurrence and severity of icing cloud layers encountered up to an altitude of 30,000 feet are presented. Jet fighters on routine operations of the Air Defense Command (USAF) near Duluth, Minnesota, and Seattle, Washington, were equipped with icing meters for 1 year. Icing occurred on approximately 5 percent of the flights, with iceaccretion thickness averaging less than 1/32 inch on a small sensing probe. Probabilities of icing severity (including average liquid-water content and maximum ice accretion) were calculated using earlier data measured in icing clouds.

ANALYSIS OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA OBTAINED DURING FLIGHT IN A SUPERCOOLED STRATIFORM CLOUD OF HIGH LIQUID-WATER CONTENT.  
Porter J. Perkins and Dwight B. Kline. July 1951. 18p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM E51D18)  
Flight icing-rate data obtained in a dense and abnormally deep supercooled stratiform cloud system in the vicinity of Lake Erie indicated the existence of liquid-water contents generally exceeding values in amount and extent previously reported over the mid-western sections of the United States. Additional information obtained during descent through a part of the cloud system indicated liquid-water contents that significantly exceeded theoretical values, especially near the middle of the cloud layer.

NACA TN 3984  
STATISTICAL STUDY OF AIRCRAFT ICING PROBABILITIES AT THE 700- AND 500- MILLEBAR LEVELS OVER OCEAN AREAS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.  
Porter J. Perkins, William Lewis, and Donald R. Mulholland. May 1957. 31p. diagrs., tabs. (NACA TN 3984)  
A statistical study is made of icing observations reported from weather reconnaissance aircraft flown by Air Weather Service (USAF). Wide areas of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans were surveyed at fixed flight levels of 500 mb (18,000 ft) and 700 mb (10,000 ft). Icing statistics presented include the relative frequencies of the occurrence of icing, the estimated probability of flight in icing, and the relation of these probabilities to the frequencies of flight in clouds and cloud temperatures. Icing probabilities varied widely throughout the year from near zero in cold Arctic areas in winter up to 7 percent in areas where greater cloudiness and warmer temperatures prevail.

SUMMARY OF STATISTICAL ICING CLOUD DATA MEASURED OVER UNITED STATES AND NORTH ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, AND ARCTIC OCEANS DURING ROUTINE AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS. Porter J. Perkins. January 1959. 89p. diagra., photos.. tabs. (NASA MEMORANDUM 1-19-59E)  
Data and statistics needed in aircraft design and operation are presented from icing-cloud measurements and observations obtained during an extensive program conducted in cooperation with several airlines and the United States Air Force. Icing meters installed on 72 service aircraft supplied information for determining the liquid-water content and distance traveled in 1300 icing-cloud encounters. Other
icing-cloud parameters measured were the temperature and depth of icing-cloud layers and a reference total ice accretion for each encounter. All results are tabulated and the measured parameters are summarized as frequency distributions.

Statistical Explanation of Spontaneous Freezing of Water Droplets.  
By Joseph Levine
NACA TN 2234 December 1950  
Abstract  
A statistical theory based on the presence of small
crystallization nuclei suspended in water is developed
to explain experimental results shoving that on the
average small droplets can be supercooled to lower temperatures than large ones. 
Small nuclei of crystallization are assumed responsible for causing supercooled
water to freeze spontaneously.  
The average behavior of supercooled droplets is
reproduced on the basis of probability theory with an
assumed distribution of crystallization nuclei with
respect to the temperatures at which the nuclei cause
freezing. The most probable distribution curves of spontaneous 
freezing temperatures for water droplets of
various sizes within the size range found in clouds are
obtained.

Photomicrographic Investigation of Spontaneous Freezing Temperatures of Supercooled Water Droplets  
By Robert G. Dorech and Paul T. Backer  
NACA TN 2142 July 1950  
Abstract  
Data obtained by a photomicrographic technique on
the spontaneous freezing temperatures of supercooled
vater droplets of the size ordinarily found in the
atmosphere are presented.  
The spontaneous freezing temperature was found to
depend on droplet size.  
Frequency distribution curver of the spontaneous
freezing temperatures observed for a given droplet
size were obtained.

EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF THE SURFACE TENSION OF SUPERCOOLED WATER. 
Paul T. Hacker. October 1981. 30p. diagrs., photon., tab. (NACA TN 3810)  
The surface tension of water has been determined
experimentally for the temperature range, 0° to
-22° C. The weak inflection point in the surface-tension temperature relation, as indicated by the
International Critical Table values for temperatures
down to -8° C, was substantiated if the measurement over the temperature range, 0° to
-22° C. The
surface tension increases it approximately a linear
rate from a value of 75.96 +/-0.06 dynes per centimeter at -8° C
to 79.67 +/-0.06 dynes per centimeter at
-22° C.

X-RAY DIFFRACTION STUDY OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF SUPERCOOLED WATER.  
Robert G. Dorsch and Bemrose Boyd. October 1951. 14p. diagrs., photo. (NACA TN 2532)  
X-ray diffraction data for water in the temperature
range 21° C to -6° C are presented. The minimum 
between two diffraction peaks deepened continuously as the temperature was lowered. 
It was concluded that supercooled water apparently becomes 
progressively more ice-like in structure as the temperature is lowered.

A PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF FREEZING OF WATER DROPLETS FALLING FREELY IN AIR
Robart G. Dorsch and Joseph Levine. February 1952, 25 p., diagrs., photos, tabs. (NACA RM E51L17)
The freezing of fee-falling water droplets in air was investigated by a photographic technique. 
Information on the following was obtained:  
(1) droplet shape after freezing, (2) the occurrence of collisions of
partly frozen or frozen and liquid droplets, and 
(3) the freezing temperatures of individual free-falling droplets.

MAXIMUM EVAPORATION RATES OF DROPLETS APPROACHING OBSTACLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE UNDER ICING CONDITIONS.  
Merman M. Lowell. October 1953. 56 p. diagrs. tabs. (NACA TN 3024)  
Maximum possible evaporation rates of water
droplets approaching obstacles in the atmosphere
along stagnation lines or moving ith intake ducts
of airplanes under icing conditions were calculated
for a wide variety of ambient conditions, flight Mach
numbers, degrees of stagnation of the incident relative air stream, and droplet diameters. 
Droplet diameter, body size, and flight Mach number effects
were found to predominate, whereas wide variation
in ambient conditions had little effect on evaporative
losses. It was concluded that little or no evaporative loss occurs from droplets approaching small
obstacles such as liquid-vater content measurement 
cylinders, whereas losses may be
percent in the case of larger obstacles such as 
wings, or 50 percent in the case of ducts at high 
ram pressure. Losses in ducts in general, however,
will usually be about 10 to 20 percent.

Kinetic Temperature of Wet Surfaces  
A Method of Calculating the Amount of Alcohol Required to Prevent Ice, and
the Derivation of the Psychrometric Equation  
By J. K. Hardy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment
Reports and Memoranda No. 2830  September 1945  
Summary. - A method is given for calculating the temperature of a surface wetted either by a pure liquid, such
as water, or by a mixture, such as alcohol and water. The method is applied to the problem of protecting, by
alcohol, propellers and the induction system of the engine against ice. The minimum quantity of alcohol required
is calculated for a number of arbitrarily chosen conditions. The effect of evaporation of alcohol is shown by
repeating the calculations for a non-volatile fluid. The method can be applied to other problems i evaporation,
for instance, to the evaporation of fuel in the induction system of the engine. The psychrometric equation, used
in wet-bulb hygrometry, is deduced in ts general form. The effect of kinetic heating is included in this equation.

Initial development has been made of an instrument
which could be used to obtain statistical fight data
on the liquid-water content of icing clouds and to
Provide a direct indication of icing severity. The
ment of the instrument consists of a wire which was heated by passing electrical through
it. The wire was mounted in the air stream and the
gages of cooling resulting from evaporation of
impinging water droplets as a measure of the liquid-water content of the cloud. 
Comparisons are made
of the liquid-water content is measured with heated
wires and absorbent cylinders in an artificially
produced cloud. Performance characteristics of a
Heated-wire instrument are presented.

FLIGHT CAMERA FOR PHOTOGRAPHING CLOUD DROPLETS IN NATURAL SUSPENSION IN THE ATMOSPHERE.  
Stuart McCullough and Porter J. Perkins.  
June 1851. 23p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM E50K01a)  
A camera designed for use in fight has been developed 
by the NACA Lewis laboratory to photograph
cloud droplets in the natural suspension in the
atmosphere. A magnification of 32 times is employed to 
distinguish for measurement purposes all
sizes of droplets greater than 5 microns in diameter,
Photographs can be taken at flight speeds up to 150
miles per hour at 5-second intervals. A field area
0.025 square inch is photographed on 7-inch-width
roll film accommodating 40 exposures on an 16-foot
length. Flight tests conducted in cumulus clouds
have shown that approximate droplet-size distribution 
studies can be obtained and that studies of 
the microstructure and physics of clouds can be
made with the camera.

Flight Instrument for Measurement of Liquid-Water Content in Clouds at Temperatures above and below Freezing.  
By Porter J. Perkins  
NACA RM E50J12a March 1951  
Abstract  
An instrument consisting of a small cylindrical
element operated at high surface temperatures was
developed to provide a simple and repid means of determining 
the liquid-water content of clouds at temperatures above and below freezing.  
The instrument was sensitive to a wide range of
liquid-water content and was calibrated against rotating
multicylinder measurements at an air temperature of
20° F, an air velocity of 175 miles per hour, and a
surface temperature in clear air of 475° F.

A SIMPLIFIED INSTRUMENT FOR RECORDING AND INDICATING FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF ICING CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED IN FLIGHT.  
Porter J. Perkins, Stuart McCullough and Ralph D.  
Lewis. July 1951. 26. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM 51E16)  
An instrument for recording and indicating the frequency and intensity of aircraft icing conditions 
encCountered in flight has been developed by the NACA
Lewis Laboratory to obtain statistical icing data
over world-wide air routes during routine airline
operations. The operation of the instrument is based 
on the creation of a differential pressure between an 
ice-free total pressure system and a total pressure system 
in which small holes vented to static pressure are allowed 
to plug with
ice accretion. The simplicity of this operating
principle permits automatic operation, and
provides relative freedom from maintenance and
operating problems. The complete unit weughing
only 18 pounds records icing rate, airspeed, and
altitude on photographic film and provides visual
indications of icing intensity to the pilot.

September 1981. 53p, diagrs.,p hotos. 4 taba. (NACA TN 2458)  
A flight instrument that uses electric means for
obtaining a measure of the droplet-size distribution
in above-freezing clouds has been devised and given
preliminary evaluation in flight. An electric charge
is placed on the droplets and they are separated
aerodynamically according to their mass. The desirable 
features of an instrument based on the
method described are: (1) the instrument can be
used in clouds with temperatures above freezing,
(2) the size and the shape of the cylinders do not
change during the exposure time, (3) the error
caused by bounce-off is low, (4) the readings
are instantaneous and continuous, and (5) the fast
instrument response permits the study of variations
in cloud structure.

Three multicylinder icing meters, fundamentally
similar but differing from each other in important
design details, were compared in use at the Mount
Washington Observatory. Comparison of relative
effectiveness of the instruments, evaluation of observational errors, 
determination of the effects of detailed design differences, 
and recommendations for
further improvements of design are presented. An
evaluation of the multicylinder method, concerned
with the validity of the theoretical basis and the degree 
to which the instruments and the technique of
their use permit accurate determinations of the physical 
measurements involved, is also included.

A Review of Instruments Developed for the Measurement of the Meteorological Factors Conducive to Aircraft Icing.  
By Alun R. Jones and William Lewis
NACA RM No. A9C09 April 1949  
Abstract  
The status of instruments suitable for the measurement 
of the meteorological factors conducive to aircraft
icing is reviewed. The factors to be evaluated are
listed, and tentative values for the desired and acceptable 
accuracy of measurement for each factor are
suggested.  
Nine instruments which appear to be the most promising 
for the procurement of the meteorological data are
discussed with respect to the quantities they measure,
principle of operation, range and accuracy, duration of a
single reading, and advantages and disadvantages associated 
with their use. Recommendations are presented for
the continued research and development of icing meteorological instruments.

Carr B. Neel.  
January 1985. 33p. diagrs., photos., tab. (NACA RM A54I23)  
A flight model of the heated-wire instrument was
tested in natural icing conditions, and was shown to
provide reliable measurements of liquid-water
content. The rapid response of the instrument
enabled detailed study of cloud structure. Cloud-duct tests showed measurements could be made up to
700 mph. Results of the flight measurements substantiated 
the high values of water content previously
predicted. The highest value measured was 3.7
grams per cubic meter.

January 1056. 36p. diagrs., photos., tabs. (NACA TN 3592)  
An airborne cloud aeroscope by which droplet size,
size distribution, and liquid-water content of icing
and nonicing clouds can be determined has been developed 
and tested in flight and in wind tunnels with
water sprays. The cloud droplets are continuously
captured In a stream of ofl, which is then photographed. 
In most cases, droplet size distribution
can be obtained from a single photograph. With the
droplet size distribution known, the liquid-water
content of the cloud can be calculated from the geometry 
of the aeroscope, the airspeed, and the oil
flow rate. The aeroscope is described in detail,
and some droplet size distributions and liquid-water
contents obtained during tests are presented.

September 1951 181p. diagrs., 11 tabs. (NACA TN 2476)  

A method is developed which permits the determination of area, rate, and distribution of water drop 
impingement on airfoils of arbitrary section at subsonic speeds. The method, which is based on the
results calculated over five airfoils cases 
requires only a few simple numerical computations 
once the velocity distribution over the airfoil bas been determined.

NACA TECHNICAL NOTE No. 1397  
A METHOD FOR NUMERICALLY CALCULATING THE AREA AND DISTRIBUTION OF WATER IMPINGEMENT ON THE LEADING EDGE OF AN AIRFOIL IN A CLOUD  
Norman R. Bergrun  
SUMMARY  
A method is presented for determining, by step-by-step integration, 
the trajectories of water drops around any body in two-dimensional 
flow for which the streamline velocity components are
known or can be computed. The method is general and considers the
deviation of the water drops from Stokes' law because of speed and
drop size.  
The equations are presented in general form and then, to
illustrate the procedure, water-drop trajectories are calculated
about a 12-percent-thick symmetrical Joukowski profile chosen to
simulate an NACA 0012 section.  
The method provides a means for the relatively rapid calculation
of the trajectory of a single drop without the utilization of a
differential analyzer.  
In addition, consideration is given to the maximum possible rate
of water-drop impingement on a body.

droplet impingement, and the rate of droplet impingement 
were calculated from the trajectories. The results are 
applicable under the following conditions:
chord lengths from 2 to 30 feet, altitudes from 1000
to 38,000 feet, airplane speeds from 180 miles per
hour to the critical ight Mach number, and droplet

Paul T. Hacker, Rinaldo J. Brun and Bemrose Boyd. September 1953. 8p. diagrs., 2 tabs. (NACA TN 2099)
Trajectories were determined for droplets in air
flowing through 90° elbows especially designed for
two-dimensional potential motion with low pressure
losses. The elbows were established by selecting
88 walls of each elow two streamlines of the flow
field produced by a complex potential function that
establishes a two-dimensional flow around a 90°
bend. An unlimited number of elbows with slightly
different shapes can be established by selecting
different pairs of streamlines as walls. The elbows
produced by the complex potential function selected
are suitable for use in aircraft air-intake ducts.
The droplet impingement data derived from the
trajectories are presented along with equations in
such a manner that the collection efficiency, the
area, the rate and the distribution of droplet impingement 
can be determined for any elbow defined 
by any pair of streamlines within a portion of
the flow field established by the complex potential
function. Coordinates for some typical streamlines 
of the flow field and velocity components for
several points along these streamlines are presented in tabular form.

IMPINGEMENT OF WATER DROPLETS ON WEDGES AND DOUBLE-WEDGE AIRFOILS AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS.  
John 8. Serafini. 1984. il, 34p. diagrs. (NACA Rept. 1159. Formerly TN 2971)  
An analytical solution has been obtained for the 
equations of motion of water droplets impinging
on a wedge in two-dimensional supersonic flow field 
with a shock wave attached to the wedge. The
closed-form solution yields analytical expressions
for the equation of the droplet trajectory, the local
rate of impingement and the impingement velocity
at any point on the wedge surface, and the total rate
of impingement. The analytical expressions are
utilised to determine the impingement on the for
ward surfaces of diamond airfoils in supersonic
flow fields with attached shock waves. The results
presented include the following conditions: droplet
diameters from 2 to 100 microns,
from sea level to 30,000 feet,
free-stream static temperatures from 420° to 460° R, 
free-stream Mach numbers from 1.1 to 2.0, 
semiapex angles for the wedge from 1.14° to 7.97°, 
thickness-to-chord ratios for the diamond airfoil from 0.08 to
0.14, chord lengths from 1 to 30 feet, and angles
of attack from zero to the inverse tangent of the
airfoil thickness-to-chord ratio.

IMPINGEMENT OF WATER DROPLETS ON NACA 65A004 AIRFOIL AND EFFECT OF CHANGE IN AIRFOIL THICKNESS FROM 12 TO 4 PERCENT AT 4° ANGLE OF ATTACK. 
Rinaldo J. Brun, Helen M. Gallagher and Dorothea E. Vogt. 
November 1953. 45p. diagrs., tab. (NACA TN 3047)  

The trajectories of droplets in the air flowing past an
NACA 65A004 airfoil at an angle of attack of 4° were
determined. The amount of water in droplet form
impinging on the airfoil, the area of droplet impingement, 
and the rate of droplet impingement per unit
area on the airfoil surface were calculated from the
trajectories and presented to cover a large range of
flight and atmospheric conditions. The effect of a
change In airfoil thickness from 12 to 4 percent at 4°
angle of attack Is presented by comparing the impingement 
calculations for the NACA 65A004 airfoil
with those for the NACA 651-208 and 65-213 airfoils. 
The rearward limit of impingement on the
upper surface decreases as the airfoil thickness decreases. 
The rearward limit of impingement on the
lower surface increases with a decrease in airfoil
thickness. The total water intercepted decreases as
the airfoil thickness is decreased.

The trajectories of droplets in the air flowing past
NACA 651,-208 AND 651-212, both at an angle of attack of 4°, were
compared with a mechanical analog. The amount

March 1953. 71p. diagrs., photo. 4 abs. (NACA TN 2904)  

The trajectories of water droplets in an incompressible 
flow field around a cylinder were calculated with
a mechanical analog. The collection efficiency, the
area of droplet impingement on the cylinder, and the
rate of droplet impingement were determined from
the trajectories. An evaluation of the rotating multicylinder 
method for the measurement of droplet-site

liquid-water content was made based on the results
of the trajectory calculations.

IMPINGEMENT OF CLOUD DROPLETS ON AERODYNAMIC BODIES AS AFFECTED BY COMPRESSIBILITY OF AIR FLOW AROUND THE BODY.  
Rinaldo J. Brun, John 8. Serafini and Helen M. Gallagher. March 1953. 20p. diagra. (NACA TN 2903)  

The trajectories of water droplets in a compressible-air flow field around a cylinder were computed 
with a mechanical analog. The results of the calculations at the flight critical Mach number were 
compared with calculations of trajectories in an incompressible flow field. 
For a cylinder, the effect of compressibility of the air on the droplet trajectories was negligible 
up to the flight critical Mach number. The results obtained with the cylinder were extended to airfoils. 
This extension is possible because the incompressible flow fields of both cylinders and airfoils are 
similarly altered by compressibility.

By A. G. Guibert, E. Janssen, and W. M. Robbins  
NACA RM No. 9A05  February 1949  
Abstract  
The trajectories of waterdrops in air flowing over airfoils are determined for three 
airfoil-angle-of-attack combinations using the differential analyzer to solve the differential 
equations of motion of the waterdrops. From these trajectories the rate of water impingement, 
the area of impingement, and the distribution of impingement are determined as functions of two 
dimensionless moduli.  
Comparisons are made of the rate of water impingement on these airfoils and the rate of water 
impingement on cylinders.

A METHOD FOR DETERMINING CLOUD-DROPLET IMPINGEMENT ON SWEPT WINGS.  
Robert G. Dorsch and Rinaldo J. Brun. April 1953. 20p. diagra. (NACA TN 2931)  
The general effect of wing sweep on cloud-droplet trajectories about swept wings of high aspect ratio moving at subsonic speeds is discussed. A method of computing droplet trajectories about yawed cylinders and swept wings is presented, and illustrative droplet trajectories are computed. A method of extending two-dimensional calculations of droplet Impingement on nonswept wings to swept wings is presented. It is shown that the extent of impingement of cloud droplets on an airfoil surface, the total rate of collection of water, and the local rate of impingement per unit area of airfoil surface can be found for a swept wing from two-dimensional data for a nonswept wing. The impingement on a swept wing is obtained from impingement data for a non-swept airfoil section which is the same as the section in the normal plane of the swept wing by calculating all dimensionless parameters with respect to flow conditions in the normal plane of the swept wing.

Rinaldo J. Brun and Robert G. Dorsch. May 1954. 37p. diagrs., tab. (NACA TN 3147)  
The presence of radomes and instruments that are sensitive to water films or ice formations in the 
nose section of all-weather aircraft and missiles necessitates a knowledge of the droplet 
impingement characteristics of bodies of revolution. 
Because it is possible to approximate many of these bodies with an ellipsoid of revolution, 
droplet trajectories about an ellipsoid of revolution with a fineness ratio of 10 
were computed for incompressible axisymmetric air flow. 
From the computed droplet trajectories, the following impingement characteristics of the 
ellipsoid surface were obtained and are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters:  
(1) total rate of water impingement, (2) extent of droplet impingement zone, and (3) local rate of water impingement. 
These impingement characteristics are compared briefly with those for an ellipsoid of revolution with 
a fineness ratio of 5 reported in NACA TN 3099.

The trajectories of droplets in the air flowing past an NACA 65A004 airfoil at an angle of attack 
of 8° were determined. The amount of water in droplet form impinging on the airfoil, 
the area of droplet impingement, and the rate of droplet impingement per unit area on the airfoil

Trajectories of water droplets about an ellipsoid of revolution with a fineness ratio of 10 
(10 percent thick) in flight through a droplet field were computed with the aid of a 
differential analyzer. Analyses of these trajectories indicate that the local concentration 
of liquid water at various points about an ellipsoid varies considerably and under 
some conditions may be several times the free-stream concentration. 
Curves of the local concentration factor as a function of spatial position were obtained

A dye-tracer technique has been developed from which the droplet impingement characteristics of 
bodies can be determined by colorimetric analysis. The technique is applicable to various wind tunnels
provided the humidity of the air stream can be maintained near saturation.

IMPINGEMENT OF CLOUD DROPLETS ON A CYLINDER AND PROCEDURE FOR MEASURING LIQUID-WATER CONTENT AND DROPLET SIZES IN SUPERCOOLED CLOUDS BY ROTATING MULTICYLINDER METHOD  
By R. J. BRUN, W. LEWIS, P. J. PERKINS, and J. S. SERAFINI  
SUMMARY  
Evaluation of the rotating multicylinder method for the measurement of droplet-size distribution, volume-median droplet size, and liquid-water content in clouds showed that small uncertainties in the basic data eliminate the distinction between different cloud droplet-size distributions and are a source of large errors in the determination of the droplet size. Calculations of the trajectories of cloud droplets in incompressible and compressible flow fields around a cylinder were performed on a mechanical analog constructed for the study of the trajectories of droplets around aerodynamic bodies. Many data points were carefully calculated in order to determine precisely the rate of droplet impingement on the surface of a right circular cylinder. From the computed droplet trajectories, the following impingement characteristics of the cylinder surface were obtained and are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters: (1) total rate of water impingement, (2) extent of droplet impingement zone, and (3) local distribution of impinging water on cylinder surface.  
The rotating multicylinder method for in-flight determination of liquid-water content, droplet size, and droplet-size distribution in icing clouds is described. The theory of operation, the apparatus required, the technique of obtaining data in flight, and detailed methods of calculating the results, including necessary charts and tables, are presented. An evaluation of the multicylinder method includes the effect on final results of droplets that do not freeze completely on the cylinders after striking them, as well as probable errors in final results caused by the inherent insensitivity of the multicylinder method.

Rinaldo J. Brun. 1957. ii, 35p. diagrs., tab. (NACA Rept. 1317. Supersedes TN 3593)  
The paths of cloud droplets into two engine inlets are calculated. The amount of water in droplet form ingested by the inlets and the amount and distribution of water impinging on the inlet walls are obtained from these droplet-trajectory calculations. In both types of inlet a prolate ellipsoid of revolution (10- percent thick) represents either part or all of the forebody at the center of an annular inlet to an engine. The configurations can also represent a fuselage of an airplane with side ram-scoop inlets. The principal difference between the two inlets studied is that the inlet air velocity of one is 0.7 that of the other.

The amount of water in cloud droplet form ingested by a full-scale supersonic nose inlet with conical center body was measured. Local and total water impingement rates on the cowl and center-body surfaces were also obtained. All measurements were made with a dye-tracer technique. Inlet angles of attack of 00 and 4.20, droplet diameters from 11 to 20 microns, and ratios of inlet to free-stream velocity from 0.4 to 1.8 were studied. Measurements were confined to a free-stream Mach number of 0.237 and are extendable to other subsonic speeds by dimensionless impingement parameters.

The rate and area of cloud droplet impingement on several two-dimensional swept and unswept airfoils were obtained experimentally in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel with a dye-tracer technique. Airfoil thickness ratios of 6 to 16 percent, angles of attack from 0° to 12°, and chord sizes from 13 to 96 inches were included in the study.

Theoretical trajectories were determined for droplets in air flowing through 600 elbows. The elbows were established by selecting as walls of each elbow two streamlines of a two-dimensional flow field produced by a complex potential function. These elbows are suitable for use in aircraft air-inlet ducts. Droplet impingement data are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters along with empirical equations so that the results can be applied over a wide range of conditions and elbow sizes. A comparison of the 60° elbow with previous calculations for a comparable 90° elbow indicated that the impingement characteristics of the two elbows are very similar.

The rate and area of cloud droplet impingement on four bodies of revolution were obtained experimentally in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel. Spheres, ellipsoidal forebodies of fineness ratios of 2.5 and 3.0, and a conical forebody of 30° included angle were studied at angles of attack of 0° to 6°, rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm, and an airspeed of 157 knots.

The trajectories of droplets in the air flowing past a 36.5-percent-thick Joukowski airfoil at zero angle of attack were determined. The amount of water in droplet form impinging on the airfoil, the area of droplet impingement, and the rate of droplet impingement per unit are on the airfoil surface were calculated from the trajectories and cover a large range of flight and atmospheric conditions. With the detailed impingement information available, the 36.5- percent-thick Joukowski can serve the dual purpose of use as the principal element in instruments for making measurements in clouds and of a basic shape for estimating impingement on a thick streamlined body.

USE OF TRUNCATED FLAPPED AIRFOILS FOR IMPINGEMENT AND ICING TESTS OF FULL-SCALE LEADING-EDGE SECTIONS.  
Uwe H. von Glahn. July 1956. 29p. diagrs, photos., tabs. (NACA RM E56E11)  
Experimental studies were made with an NACA 651-212 airfoil section truncated at the 30- and 50- percent-chord stations and equipped with a trailing-edge flap. When the truncated airfoils were compared with the full-chord airfoils, the velocity distribution and the impingement characteristics were similar with the flap properly deflected, but were altered substantially without flap deflection. Use of flapped truncated airfoils permits impingement and icing studies in icing tunnels to be conducted with full-scale leading-edge sections over a greater range of conditions than previously possible.

A FLIGHT INVESTIGATION OF THE THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF AN AIR-HEATED PROPELLER   
John F. Darsow and James Selna  
SUMMARY  
Observations were made during flight in natural-icing conditions and
by the collection of thermal data on the propeller during flight in clear
air and in clouds at temperatures above freezing. The propeller was
equipped with standard hollow steel blades which were altered to permit
heated air to enter the blade cavities at the propeller hub and to leave
the cavities at the blade tips. The distribution or air flow inside the
blades was not controlled.  

The observations in natural-icing conditions together with the thermal 
test data indicate that little or no protection to the leading-edge
region of the propeller blades would result during flight in severe
natural-icing conditions. In natural-icing conditions only light-icing
conditions were encountered; however, ice accretions formed on the leading
edges or the blades in the region of blade stations 30 to 40. The clear
air and cloud tests showed the propeller blades to be inefficient heat exchangers 
in that more heat energy was discharged in the air flow leaving
the propeller than was dissipated through the propeller-blade surfaces.
The measured blade-surface temperatures indicated that inadequate heating
was provided to the leading-edge region or the propeller and snow the need
of providing means to increase the heat flow through the leading-edge region or the blades.

Icing and De-Icing of a Propeller with Internal Electric Blade Heaters  
Abstract  
De-icing effectiveness of internal electric
propeller-blade heater was determined at two icing and
two operating conditions with heat applied continuously 
and cyclically, and the required heat-on and
cycle times are shown.  
Chordwise extent of icing was greater than that
covered by bdlade heaters. Adequate de-icing in heated
area with continuous heating was obtained with power
available but maximum power input of 1250 watts per
blade was insufficient for cyclic de-icing. Surface
temperature-rise rates of 0.2° to 0,7° F per second
were obtained and minimum cooling period for cylio
de-icing was approximately 2.55 times the heating period,

De-Icing Effectiveness of External Electric Heaters for Propeller Blades.  
By James P. Lewis  
NACA TN No. 1520  February 1948  
Abstract  
Icing protection provided by external rubber-clad
propeller blade heaters at several icing, heating, and
propeller operating conditions has been determined.
Effects of propeller speed, ambient-air temperature,
liquid water concentration, heating power density, duration 
of heating, and total cycle time on power requirements 
and de-icing performance were investigated.  
Power densities of 4 to 10 watts per square inch
were required for cyclic de-icing with best chordwise
distribution approaching uniformity. Heating times of
approximately 24 seconds were required with ratio of
heat-on to total cycle time of 1:4 giving best results.  
Mean rate of rise of heater temperature of approximately
1.1° F per second was obtained.

made to determine the relation of indicated shaft
thrust to net propeller thrust.

Abstract  
An icing investigation of an air-heated hollow

Results showed that at 850 rpm a heating rate
of 7000 Btu per hour per blade provided adequate

Surface temperatures indicated satisfactory chord-wise distribution. 
The blade heat-exchanger effectiveness was found to be 77 percent.

INVESTIGATION OF AIR-HEATING OF A HOLLOW STEEL PROPELLER FOR PROTECTION AGAINST ICING II - 50-PERCENT PARTITIONED BLADES  
By Porter J. Perkins and Donald R. Mulholland  
The icing protection afforded an internal air-heated propeller
blade by radial partitioning at 50-percent chord to confine the
heated air to the forWard half of the blade was determined in the
NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel. A modified production-model
hollow steel propeller, was used for the investigation. Temperatures
of the blade surfaces for several heating rates were measured under
various tunnel icing conditions. Photographic observations of ice
formations on blade surfaces and blade heat-exchanger effectiveness
were obtained.  
With 50-percent partitioning of the blades, adequate icing protection 
at 1050 rpm was obtained with a heating rate of 26,000 Btu
per hour per blade at the blade shank using an air temperature of
4000 F with a flow rate of 280 pounds per hour per blade, which is
one-third less heat than was found necessary for similar ice protection 
with unpartitioned blades. The chordwise distribution of
the applied heat, as determined by surface temperature measurements,
was considered unsatisfactory with much of the heat dissipated well
back of the leading edge. Heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 
56 percent also indicated poor utilization of available heat.
This effectiveness was, however, 9 percent greater than that obtained
from unpartitioned blades.

The propeller blade is analytically divided into a number of short
radial segments, successively treated as separate heat exchangers. Expressions 
for the total external and internal heat transfer are combined
to determine the surface temperatures of each segment. The thermodynamic
steady-flow equation is given for the internal gas-flow process and expressions 
are obtained for the radial variations of gas temperature and
pressure within the blade. For a given initial gas temperature in the
blade shank cavity, the minimum gas flow is determined, which will provide 
surface temperatures of at least 32° F everywhere on the heated
portion of the blade. An expression for the required heat-source input
to the gas is included and a formula is given for calculating the required 
blade-tip nozzle area.

AN INVESTIGATION UTILIZING AN ELECTRICAL ANALOGUE OF CYCLIC DE-ICING OF A HOLLOW STEEL PROPELLER WITH AN EXTERNAL BLADE SHOE.  
Carr B. Neel, Jr. December 1052. 54p. diagrs., photos., 3 tabs. (NACA TN 2852)  
A study of the heat requirements for cyclic de-icing
of hollow steel propellers fitted with external blade
shoes, utilizing an electrical analogue, showed how
energy requirements could be decreased by changes
in the method of operation of existing shoes and
through proper blade-shoe design. Savings in total
energy in the order of 80 percent would be possible
in each case. Energy requirements were shown to
increase with decreasing liquid-water content and
air temperature.

Carr B. Neel, Jr. October 1953. 31p. diagrs., photo., 3 tabs. (NACA TN 3055)  
An analytical study, utilizing an electrical analogue,
of the heat requirements for cyclic de-icing of hollow
steel propellers fitted with two types of internal
electric heaters showed the impracticability of using
an internal tubular heater, and illustrated the
advantages of employing an internal shoe-type heater
to distribute the heat more evenly to the blade surface. 
The importance of minimizing the thermal
inertia of the system was demonstrated, and the
magnitude of reductions in the total energy requirement 
made possible through reductions in heating
period was indicated.

THE EFFECT OF ICE FORMATIONS ON PROPELLER PERFORMANCE  
By Carr B. Neel, Jr., and Loren G. Bright  
SUMMARY  
Measurements of propeller efficiency loss due to ice formation are
supplemented by an analysis to establish the magnitude of efficiency
losses to be anticipated during flight in icing conditions. The measurements 
were made during flight in natural icing conditions; whereas the
analysis consisted of an investigation of changes in blade-section aerodynamic 
characteristics caused by ice formation and the resulting propeller 
efficiency changes. Agreement in the order of magnitude of efficiency 
losses tobe expected is obtained between measured and analytical
results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can
be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which
will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent.
Reported. losses larger than 15 or 20 percent, based on reductions in
airplane performance, probably are due to ice accretions on other parts
of the airplane.  
Blade-element theory is used in the analytical treatment, and calculations 
are made to show the degree to which the aerodynamic characteristics 
of a blade section. must be altered to produce various propeller
efficiency losses. The effects of ice accretions on airfoil-section
characteristics at subcritical speeds and their influence on drag-divergence 
Mach number are examined, and. the attendant maximum efficiency
losses are computed. The effect of kinetic heating on the radial extent
of ice formation is considered, and its influence on required length of
blade heating shoes is discussed. It is demonstrated how the efficiency
loss resulting from an icing encounter is influenced by the decisions of
the pilot in adjusting the engine and propeller controls.

INVESTIGATION OF ICING CHARACTERISTICS OF TYPICAL LIGHT-AIRPLANE ENGINE INDUCTION SYSTEM  
By Willard D. Coles  
SUMMARY  
The icing characteristics of two typical light-airplane engine
induction systems were investigated using the carburetors and manifolds 
of engines in the horsepower ranges from 65 to 85 and 165 to 185. 
The smaller system consisted of a float-type carburetor with
an unheated manifold and the larger system consisted of a single-barrel 
pressure-type carburetor with an oil-jacketed manifold.  
Carburetor-air temperature and humidity limits of visible and
serious icing were determined for various engine power conditions.
Several methods of achieving ice-free induction systems are discussed 
along with estimates of surface heating requirements of the
various induct ion-system components.  
A study was also made of the icing characteristics of a typical
light-airplane air scoop with an exposed filter and a modified
system that provided a normal ram inlet with the filter located in
a position to Induce inertia separation of the free water from the
charge air.  
The principle of operation of float-type carburetors is proved
to make them inherently more susceptible to icing at the throttle
plate than pressure-type carburetors. The results indicated that proper
jacketing and heating of all parts exposed to the fuel spray can
satisfactorily reduce or eliminate icing in the float-type carburetor
and the manifold. Pressure-type carburetors can be protected from
serious Icing by proper location of the fuel-discharge nozzle combined 
with suitable application of heat to critical parts.

ICING-PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR RECIPROCATING-ENGINE INDUCTION SYSTEMS  
by Willard D. Coles, Vern G. Rollin, and Donald R. Mulholland   
NACA-TR-982, 1950  
SUMMARY  
Despite the development of relatively ice-free fuel-metering
systems, the widespread use of alternate and heated-air intakes,
and the use of alcohol for emergency de-icing, icing of aircraft-engine 
induction systems is a serious problem. Investigations
have been made to study and to combat all phases of thin icing
problem. From these investigations, criterions for safe operation 
and for design of new induction systems have been established.  
The results were obtained from laboratory investigations of
carburetor-supercharger combinations, wind-tunnel investigations 
of air scoops, multicylinder-engine studies, and fight
investigations. Characteristics of the three forms of ice, impact,
throttling, and fuel evaporation, were studied. The effects of
serveral factors on the icing characteristics were also studied and
included (1) atmospheric conditions, (2) engine and air-scoop
configurations, including light airplane systems, (3) type of
fuel usd, and (4) operating variables, such as power condition,
use of a manifold pressure regulator, mixture setting, carburetor
heat, and water-alcohol injection. In addition, ice-detection
methods were investigated and methods of preventing and removing 
induction-system ice were studied. Recommendations
are given for design and operation with regard to induction-system icing.

James P. Lewis. July 1953. 42p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM E53EO7)  
An investigation of the aerodynamic and icing characteristics 
of a full-scale induction-system air-scoop
assembly incorporating a flush-type alternate inlet
was conducted in the NACA Lewis icing research
tunnel. The investigation was made over a range of
mass-air-flow ratios, angles of attack, airspeeds,
air temperatures, liquid-water content, and droplet
sizes. The ram inlet gave good pressure recovery
in both clear air and icing, the rapid blocking of the
carburetor screen occurred in icing. The alternate
inlet had poor pressure recovery in both clear air
end icing, but no serious screen icing was obtained.
The investigation included the use of preheat air
alone and a combination with ram- and alternate
inlet air.

Natural Icing of an Axial-Flow Turbojet Engine in Flight for a Single Icing Condition.  
By Loren W. Acker  
NACA RM No. E8F01a  August 12, 1948  
Abstract  
A flight investigation in natural icing conditions
was conducted to determine the effect of ice formations
on performance of axial-flow turbojet engines. Results
are presented for a flight in which liquid-water content
varied from 0.077 to 0.490 gram per cubic meter.  
During 60 minutes in icing, tail-pipe temperature
increased from 865° to 965° F and the jet thrust
decreased from 1950 to 1700 pounds. The engine was
satisfactorily accelerated to take-off power near the
end of the icing period.

Abstract  
A flight investigation in naturel icing conditions
was conducted to determine effect of ice formations
on performance of an axial-flow turbojet engine.
Results are presented for a flight in which the icing
rate varied from 5.1 to 2.1 inches per hour.  
During 45 minutes in icing, tail-pipe temperature
increased from 761° to 1065° F and jet thrust decreased
from 1234 to 910 pounds. Ice penetrated to the second-stage stator blades.

Icing Characteristics and Anti-Icing Heat Requirements for Hollow and Internally Modified Gas-Heated Inlet Guide Vanes.  
By Vernon H. Gray and Dean T. Bowden  
NACA RM E50I08  December 1950  
Abstract  
Gas temperatures and flow rates required for anti-icing 
a two-dimensional cascade of turbojet inlet guide
vanes were determined for hollow and internally modified
vanes. The pressure losses caused by icing on unheated
guide vanes were also determined.  
Less heat was required for anti-icing internally
modified blades than for the hollow blades. Pressure
losses across the cascade were greater at an inlet
temperature of 22° F than at 0° F because of the
characteristic shapes of ice deposits at the two
temperatures.

INVESTIGATION OF HEAT TRANSFER FROM A STATIONARY AND ROTATING ELLIPSOIDAL FOREBODY OF FINENESS RATIO 3.  
James P. Lewis and Robert S. Ruggeri. November 1956. 48p. diagrs., photo., tabs. (NACA TN 3837)  
Experimental convective heat transfer wss obtained
for a 20-inch-diameter forebody for airspeeds up to
240 knots, rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm, angles
of attack of 0°, 3°, and 6°, and both uniform surface
temperature and uniform input heat density. The
results agree well with theoretical predictions. Affects 
of rotation were insignificant, and effects of
angle of attack only minor. Transition from laminar
to turbulent heat transfer varied over a Reynolds
number range of 0.8 x 10^6 to 8 x 10^6. Limited transient 
heating data indicated that the change of surface
temperature with time followed an exponential
relation.

Robert S. Ruggeri and James P. Lewis.  
October 1957. 30. diagrs., photo., tab. (NACA TN 4093)  
Experimental convective heat transfer was determined 
for a conical forebody (15° half-angle) for
free-stream velocities w to 400 feet per second,
rotational speeds of to 1200 rpm, angles of attack of
9° and 6°, and for heating conditions of uniform surface 
temperature and uniform heater input power
density. For the turbulent region, the results were
in closer agreement with values predicted for two-dimensional 
bodies than with those predicted for a
cone. Effects of rotation were insignificant. For
the stationary spinner at 0° angle of attack, the heat-transfer 
coefficients were 6 to 13 percent greater on
the lower surface than on the upper surface. Early
boundary-layer transition occurred for all conditions
investigated.

Investigation of Power Requirements for Ice Prevention and Cyclical De-Icing of Inlet Guide Vanes with Internal Electric Heaters.  
By Uve von Glalm and Robert E. Blatz  
NACA RM E50H29  December 1950  
Abstract  
An investigation was conducted to determine the
electric pover requirements for turbojet-engine inlet
guide vanes with continuous heating and with cyclical
de-icing for a range of icing conditions.  
Minimum total power requirements for continuous
heating and cyclical de-icing are presented in terms of
average surface datum temperature. An analysis is
included to extend the experimentally obtained continuous 
heating data to vane sizes and icing conditions
other than those investigated. Cyclical de-icing
provides a total pover saving as high as 79 percent over
continuous heating for a typical engine installation.
Heat-on periods of 10 seconds or less with heat-off
periods of 60 seconds are recommended for cyclical
de-icing.

NACA Investigations of Icing-Protection Systems for Turbojet-Engine Installations.  
By Uwe von Glahn, Edmund E. Callaghan, and Vernon H. Gray

May 1951  
Abstract  
A summary is presented of the investigations made in flight and in wind tunnels at the NACA Lewis laboratory to determine which components of turbojet engines are most critical in icing conditions and to evaluate several icing-protection methods.  
Complete removal or retraction of compressor-inlet screens upon entering icing conditions is recommended. Surface heating appears to be the most acceptable icing-protection method, although hot-gas bleedback offers a simple method for obtaining icing protection on some installations.

Thomas F. Gelder. September 1957. 41p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM E57G09)  
Ice was formed on a full-scale unheated supersonic nose inlet over a range of conditions in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel to determine its effect on compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery. The addition of ice to the inlet components increased distortion levels and decreased recovery values compared with clear-air results, the losses increasing with time in icing. The combination of glaze ice, high corrected weight flow, and high angle of attack yielded the highest levels of distortion and lowest values of recovery.

Investigation of Aerodynamic and Icing Characteristics of Water-Inertia-Separation Inlets for Turbojet Engines. 
By Uwe von Glahn and Robert E. Blatz  
NACA RM E50E03  July 1950  
Abstract  
Aerodynamic and icing investigations of several
internal water-inertia-separation inlets designed to
prevent entrance of water into a turbojet engine in an
icing condition are presented. Comparisons of total
Pressure loss, mass flow, and icing charecteristics are
made.  
Complete ioing protection of inlet guide vanes was
not achieved. Approximately 8 percent af the volume of
water entering the inlets remained in the air. For mon-
icing operation, total-pressure losses were comparable
to those of direct-ram inlets. Under icing conditions,
considerable total-pressure losses were obtained with
inertia-separation inlets.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE DISSIPATION OF HEAT IN CONDITIONS OF ICING FROM A SECTION OF THE WING OF THE C-46 AIRPLANE  
J. K. Hardy  
SUMMARY  
A method is given for calculating the temperature that a
surface, heated internally by air, will assume in specified conditions 
of icing. The method can be applied generally to predict 
the performance, under conditions of icing, of the thermal
system for protecting aircraft. Calculations have been made
for a section of the wing of the C-46 airplane, and the results
agree closely with the temperatures measured. The limit of
protection, when the temperature of the surface reaches 32° F,
has been predicted for the leading edge. The temperature of
the surface in conditions of icing with air at 0° F also has been
calculated. The effect of kinetic heating and the effect of the
concentration of free water and size of droplet in the cloud are
demonstrated.

THE CALCULATION OF THE HEAT REQUIRED FOR WING THERMAL ICE PREVENTION IN SPECIFIED ICING CONDITIONS  
By Carr B. Neel, Jr., Norman R. Bergrun, David Jukoff, and. Bernard A. Shlaff  
SUMMARY  
As a result of a fundamental investigation of the meteorological
conditions conducive to the formation of ice on aircraft and a study
of the process of airfoil thermal ice prevention, previously derived
equations for calculating the rate of heat transfer from airfoils in
icing conditions were verified. Knowledge of the manner in which
water is deposited on and evaporated from the surface of a heated
airfoil was expanded sufficiently to allow reasonably accurate calculations 
of airfoil heat requirements. The research consisted of
flight tests in natural-icing conditions with two 8-foot-chord. heated
airfoils of different sections. Measurements of the meteorological
variables conducive to ice formation were made simultaneously with the
procurement of airfoil thermal data.  
It was concluded that the extent of knowledge on the meteorology
of icing, the impingement of water drops on airfoil surfaces, and the
processes of heat transfer and evaporation from a wetted airfoil
surface has been increased to a point where the design of heated wings
on a fundamental, wet-air basis now can be undertaken with reasonable
certainty.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF CYCLICAL DE-ICING OF A GAS-HEATED AIRFOIL.  
V. H. Gray, D. T. Bowden and U. von Glahn. January 1952. 38p. photos., diagrs., tab. (NACA RM 5129)  

An NACA 65-212 airfoil of 8-foot chord was provided 
with a gas-heated leading edge for investigations 
of cyclical de-icing. De-icing was accomplished 
with intermittent heating of airfoil segments
that supplied hot gas to chordwise passages in a
double-akin construction. Ice removal was facilitated 
by a spanwise leading-edge parting strip which
was continuously heated from the gas-supply duct.
Preliminary results demonstrate that satisfactory
cyclical ice removal occurs with ratios of total cycle
time to heat-on period from 10 to 26.

James P. Lewis and Dean T. Bowden. February 1952. 43p. photos, diagrs. (NACA RM E5130)  
An investigation was conducted in the NACA Lewis
icing research tunnel to determine the characteristics 
and requirements of cyclic de-icing of an airfoil
by use of an external electric heater. The present
investigation was limited to an airspeed of 175 miles
per hour. Data are presented to show the effects of
variations in heat-on and heat-off periods, ambient
air temperature, liquid-water content, angle of attack
and heating distribution on the requirements for
cyclic de-icing. The external heat flow at various
icing and heating conditions is also presented. A
continuously heated parting strip at the airfoil leading 
edge was found necessary for quick, complete,
and consistent ice removal. The cyclic power
requirements were found to be primarily a function of
the datum temperature and heat-on time, with the
other operating and meteorological variables having a
second-order effect. Short heat-on periods and high
power densities resulted in the most efficient ice
removal, the minimum energy input, and the minimum 
runback ice formations.

An experimental investigation of the heat transfer
from an 8-foot-chord airfoil model in clear air and
in simulated icing conditions was conducted in the
icing tunnel. These results are compared with those
obtained in a flight investigation with the same model
at similar operating conditions. The tunnel results
indicate the effect of tunnel turbulence by the forward
movement of transition from laminar to turbulent
heat transfer. The flight results indicate that the
convective heat transfer in icing is considerably
different from that measured in clear air and only
slightly different from that obtained in the tunnel
during simulated icing.

The effects of existing frictional heating were analyzed 
to determine the conditions under which ice
formations on aircraft surfaces can be prevented. A
method is presented for rapidly determining by
means of charts the combination of Mach number,
altitude, and stream temperature which will maintain
an ice-free surface in an icing cloud. The method
can be applied to both subsonic and supersonic flow.
The charts presented are for Mach numbers up to

feet.

(NACA TN 2861)  

Calculations have been made for the icing limit of a
diamond airfoil at sero angle of attack in terms of
the stream Mach number, stream temperature, and
pressure altitude. The icing limit is defined as a
wetted-surface temperature of 32° F and is related
to the stream conditions by the method of Hardy.
The results show that the point most likely to ice on
the airfoil lies immediately behind the shoulder and
is subject to possible icing at Mach numbers as high
as 1.4.

The performance characteristics of three cyclic,
electric, rubber-clad de-icing boots were evaluated.
Each boot was operated in icing at design specifications 
of 21 watts per square inch for cycled areas,
13 watts per square inch for continuously heated
parting strips, a heat-on time of 10 seconds, and a
cycle ratio of 10. For a free-stream velocity of
approximately 395 feet per second, the range of free-stream 
total temperature at which the icing protection 
afforded by the various boots became marginal
was from 12° to 15° F for values of liquid-water
content employed. The runback characteristics
of the boots were similar. The forward cycled
segments, upper and lower surfaces, were the most
critical areas for the three boots investigated.

Several methods of cyclic de-icing of a gas-heated
airfoil were investigated to determine ice-removal
characteristics and heating requirements. The cyclic
de-icing system with a spanwise ice-free parting
strip in the stagnation region and a constant-
temperature gas-supply duct gave the quickest and
most reliable ice removal. Heating requirements
for the several methods of cyclic de-icing are
compared, and the savings over continuous ice
prevention are shown. Data are presented to show
the relation of surface temperature, rate of surface
heating, and heating time to the removal of ice.

The procedure to be followed in the design of aircraft

the required heat-transfer and air-pressure-loss
equations, a simple electrical analogue is described

An investigation was conducted in the NACA Lewis
icing research tunnel to determine heating requirements 
and characteristics of a gas-heated porous
leading-edge system for anti-icing of a delta wing.
Adequate icing protection was obtained for all icing
conditions investigated. Large savings in gas flow
may be realized by sealing hall the upper-surface
porous area. Gas flow through the porous area
caused only a slight increase in airfoil drag ard had
no appreciable effect on airfoil pressure distribution
Glaze-icE formations on the unheated airfoil caused
rapid increases in section drag.

Heating requirements for satisfactory cyclic de-icing 
over a wide range of icing and operating conditions 
have been obtained for a gas-heated, 36° swept
airfoil with a partial-span leading-edge slat. Comparisons 
of heating requirements were made between
the slatted and unslatted portions of the airfoil and
between cyclic de-icing and continuous anti-icing.
Cyclic de-icing systems with and without leading-edge 
ice-free parting strips were also evaluated.

Abstract  
Icing and drag investigations were conducted in
the NACA L wis icing research tunnel on a thermal-pneumatic 
de-icer mounted on a 42-inch-chord NACA 0018
airfoil. Marginal power densities for the leading-edge

were made between the bare airfoil and the various

EFFECT OF ICE FORMATIONS ON SECTION DRAG OF SWEPT NACA 634-000 AIRFOIL WITH PARTIAL-SPAN LEADING-EDGE SLAT FOR VARIOUS MODES OF THERMAL ICE PROTECTION.  
Uwe H. von Glahn and Vernon H. Gray. March 1954. 59p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM ES3J30)  

Studies were made to determine the effect of ice
formations on the section drag of a 6.9-foot-chord
the partial-span leading edge flap. In general, 
the icing of a thin, swept airfoil will result in greater aerodynamic 
penalties than for a thick unswept airfoil. Glaze ice
formations at the leading edge of the airfoil caused
large increases in section drag even at a liquid-water
content of 0.59 gram per cubic meter. The use of an
ice-free parting strip in the stagnation region caused
a negligible change in drag compared with a completely 
unheated airfoil. Cyclic de-icing when
properly applied caused the drag to decrease almost
to the bare-airfoil drag value.

Studies were made to determine the effect of ice and
frost formations on the drag of an 8-foot-chord
NACA 65-212 airfoll. At high angles of attack (89),
glaze-ice formations on the upper surface near the
leading edge of an airfoil caused large increases in
drag and incipient stalling of the airfoil. Runback
icing on the lower surface, excepting for heavy span-wise 
ice ridges, presented no serious drag problems.
Rime-ice formations on the leading edge did not
cause large drag increases. Cyclic de-icing of the
leading edge successfully decreased the drag almost
to the bare airfoil drag value. Frost formations on
airfoil surfaces drag increases asd
may result in stalling of the airfoil.

Effects of Ice Formations on Airplane Performance in Level Cruising Flight.  
By G. Merritt Preston and Calvin C. Blackman
NACA TN No. 1598 May 1948

Abstract

Flight investigation in natural icing conditions 
was conducted to determine effect of ice
accretion on airplane performance.  
Maximum loss in propeller efficiency encountered 
was 19 percent. During 87 percent of the
propeller icing encounters, losses of 10 percent or
less were observed. Ice formations on all components 
of the airplane except the propellers during one 
icing encounter resulted in an increase in
parasite drag of the airplane of 81 percent. The
control response of the airplane in this condition
was marginal.

The heating requirements for several methods of

operating over a probable range of icing conditions 
are evaluated, and the airplane performance
penalties associated with providing this protection
from various energy sources are assessed. Continuous 
heating requirements and airplane penalties
for the turbojet transport are considerably increased

Dean T. Bowden. February 1956. 59p. diagrs., photos. (NACA TN 3564)  

Measurement of drag, lift, and pitching moment of
an NACA 0011 airfoil were made in icing conditions
using pneumatic de-icers having either spanwise or
chordwise inflatable tubes. Lift and drag penalties
due to de-icer inflation and to ice remaining after deicer 
inflation are presented. Inflation of the
spanwise-tube de-icer caused a much greater increase 
in drag than inflation of the chordwise-tube
de-icer. The two de-icers were equally effective in
removing ice. Lift and drag penalties resulting from
ice formed with the de-icer inoperative are also presented, 
as well as spoiler data for analyzing drag
increases due to ice formations.

CORRELATIONS AMONG ICE MEASUREMENTS, IMPINGEMENT RATES, ICING CONDITIONS, AND DRAG COEFFICIENTS FOR UNSWEPT NACA 65A004 AIRFOIL.  
Vernon B. Gray. February 1958. 45p. diagrs., phots., tabs. (NACA TN 4151)  

An empirical relation is derived by which changes in section drag coefficients due to ice on an NACA 65A004 airfoil are calculable from known icing and operating conditions. The correlation is obtained by use of measured ice heights and ice angles. Initial ice weights are in agreement with droplet impingement data; in glaze conditions, ice weights increase at progressively greater rates with time.

AERODYNAMIC EFFECTS CAUSED BY ICING OF AN UNSWEPT NACA 65A004 AIRFOIL. 
Vernon H. Gray and Uwe H. von Glahn. February 1958. 47p. diagr tabs. (NACA TN 4155)  

At angles of attack less than 4° both rime and glaze-ice 
formations increased drag, reduced lift, and
reduced diving moments. At angles of attack greater
than 4°, drag coefficients increased with glaze-ice
formations and decreased with rime ice; Lift coefficients 
generally increased with glaze ice and were
variably affected by rime ice; pitching-moment
changes were rather erratic and depended on the ice
shape. When the airfoil was iced at high angles of
attack and rotated to lower angles, large negative
pitching moments ware obtained. Ice formations on
the airfoil had no significant effects on control-surface hinge moments.

PREDICTION OF AERODYNAMIC PENALTIES CAUSED BY ICE FORMATIONS ON VARIOUS AIRFOILS.  
Vernon H. Gray. February 1964. 19p. OTS price, $0.50. (NASA TECHNICAL NOTE D-2166)  
An equation is presented by which changes in drag coefficients due to ice formations on airfoils with thickness ratios up to 15 percent may be calculated from known icing and flight conditions. Based on limited data, changes in lift and pitching-moment coefficients due to ice on thick, blunt airfoils may be estimated from the corresponding changes in drag coefficients; for thin airfoils at higher angles of attack no general relation is obtained.

A METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE HEAT REQUIRED FOR WINDSHIELD THERMAL ICE PREVENTION BASED ON EXTENSIVE FLIGHT TESTS IN NATURAL ICING CONDITIONS  
Alun R. Jones, George H. Holdaway, and Charles P. Steinmetz  
SUMMARY  
An equation is presented for calculating the heat flow required from the surface of an internally heated windshield in order to prevent the formation of ice accretions during flight in specified icing conditions. To ascertain the validity of the equation, comparison is made between calculated values of the heat required and measured values obtained for test windshield in actual flights in icing conditions.  
The test windshields were internally heated and provided data applicable to two common types of windshield configurations; namely the V-type and the type installed flush with the fuselage contours. These windshields were installed on a twin-engine cargo airplane and the icing flights were conducted over a large area of the United States during the winters of 1945-46 and 1946-47. In addition to the internally heated windshield investigation, some test data were obtained for a windshield ice-prevention system in which heated air was discharged into the windshield boundary layer.

PRELIMINARY DATA ON RAIN DEFLECTION FROM AIRCRAFT WINDSHIELDS BY MEANS OF HIGH-VELOCITY JET-AIR BLAST.  
Robert S. Ruggeri. July 1955. 17p. diagrs., photos. (NACA RM E55E17)  

Results indicate that rain deflection by jet-air blast appears feasible for flight speeds comparable with landing and take-off; however, visibility through the mist generated by raindrop breakup presents a problem. For the simulated windshield used, air-flow rates of about 3.3 lb/min-in. of span were required for adequate rain deflection at an airspeed of 135 mph. A method was devised whereby large-diameter water drops (1000 to 1500 μ) can be produced in a moving air stream, without breakup, at speeds in excess of 175 mph.

WIND TUNNEL INVESTIGATION OF ICING OF AN ENGINE COOLING FAN INSTALLATION  
James P. Lewis  
SUMMARY  
An investigation was made of the icing characteristics and means of ice protection of a typical radial-engine cooling-fan installation. The investigation was made at various icing and performance conditions in the icing research tunnel of the NACA Cleveland laboratory.  
The icing of the unprotected cooling-fan installation was found to present a serious operational problem. Reduction in air flow below the minimum value required for engine cooling-air flow through the fan assembly occurred in as little as 5 minutes under normal icing conditions. Steam de-icing was found to be effective for the cowling lip and inlet duct. Alcohol de-icing of the fan blades and stator vanes was found to be unsatisfactory. Electrical heat de-icing of the fan blades was found to be effective but de-icing of the stator vanes was not completely effective at the power densities investigated.

AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF HEAT REQUIREMENTS FOR ICING PROTECTION OF RADOMES.  
James P. Lewis. March 1953. 20p. diagrs. (NACA RM E53A22)  

The heat requirements for the icing protection of two radome configurations have been studied over a range of design icing conditions. Both the protection limits of a typical thermal protection system and the relative effects of the various icing variables have been determined. For full evaporation of all impinging water, an effective heat density of 14 watts per square inch was required. When a combination of the full evaporation and running wet surface systems was employed, a heat requirement of 5 watts per square inch provided protection at severe icing and operating conditions.

In an investigation of radome icing and icing protection in the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel, the impingement of water and the formation of ice on two radome configurations were found to agree well with theory and experience. The ice formations on the radomes produced serious effects on radar performance. The ethylene glycol fluid-protection system gave adequate icing protection for both anti-icing and de-icing. The radomes were investigated at air-speeds up to 290 miles per hour, air total temperatures of -15° to 20° F, water contents up to 1.0 gram per cubic meter, and angles of attack of 0° and 4°.

NACA RM NO. SE9D20  
Abstract  
Vibration and icing characteristics were investigated in the NACA icing research tunnel on a CAA type V-109 very-high-frequency aircraft antenna proposed for omnidirectional-range operation. Vibration of the antenna elements was observed for both icing and non-icing conditions. Maximum vibration amplitude observed was approximately 7 inches at the end of an element 24 inches long during icing, and failure of an element occurred in one instance during icing. Vibration without ice accretion was not severe.

Investigation of Aerodynamic and Icing Characteristics of Recessed Fuel-Vent Configurations.  
By Robert S. Ruggeri, Uwe von Glahn, and Vern G. Rollin  
NACA TN No. 1789  March 1949  
Abstract  
An investigation was conducted to determine aerodynamic and icing characteristics of several recessed fuel-vent configurations.  
The vent configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, 7° ramp angle, and vent tubes manifolded to a plenum chamber gave greatest vent-tube pressures for all conditions investigated. Configurations with diverging ramp sidewalls gave greater vent-tube pressures than configurations with parallel sidewalls. In similar cloud-icing conditions, only the configuration with a plenum chamber maintained adequate vent-tube pressures throughout 60-minute icing periods. No complete closure of vent-tube openings due to ice formations occurred for configurations investigated.

INVESTIGATION OF THE PENETRATION OF AN AIR JET DIRECTED PERPENDICULARLY TO AN AIR STREAM  
Edmund E. Callaghan and Robert S. Ruggeri  
SUMMARY  
An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the penetration of a circular air jet directed perpendicularly to an air stream as a function of jet density, jet velocity, air-stream density, air-stream velocity, jet diameter, and distance downstream from the jet. The penetration was determined for nearly constant values of air-stream density at two tunnel velocities, four jet diameters, four positions downstream of the jet, and for a large range of jet velocities and densities. An equation for the penetration was obtained in terms of the jet diameter, the distance downstream from the jet, and the ratios of jet and air-stream velocities and densities.

Penetration of Air Jets Issuing from Circular, Square, and Elliptical Orifices Directed Perpendicularly to an Air Stream.  
By Robert S. Ruggeri, Edmund E. Callaghan, and Dean T. Bowden  
NACA TN 2019 February 1950  
Abstract  
The penetration of air jets directed perpendicularly to an air stream was experimentally determined. Jets issuing from circular, square, and elliptical orifices were investigated and the penetration at a position downstream of the orifice was determined as a function of Jet density, jet velocity, air-stream density, air-stream velocity, effective Jet diameter, and orifice flow coefficient. Results are correlated in terms of dimensionless parameters and the penetrations obtained with various shapes are compared.  
Greater penetrations were obtained with square orifices than with circular orifices of equal area.

Abstract  
An experimental investigation was conducted to determine orifice coefficients of a jet directed perpendicularly to an air stream as a function of pressure ratio and Jet Reynolds number for elliptical, square, and circular orifices. Effect of air-stream velocity on jet flow was determined for three tunnel-air velocities. Equations for flow coefficient in terms of jet Reynolds number and pressure ratio were obtained for various shapes.  
Excellent correlation was obtained between results for jet discharging into still air and results for jet discharging into moving air stream, provided that correct outlet pressure was used.

An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the temperature profile downstream of a heated-air jet directed at various angles to an air stream. The profiles were determined at two positions downstream of the jet as a function of jet diameter, jet density, free-stream density, jet velocity, free-stream velocity, jet total temperature, orifice flow coefficient, and jet discharge angles. A method is presented which yields a good approximation of the temperature profile in terms of dimensionless parameters of the flow and geometric conditions.

The profiles were determined at several positions downstream of the jet as a function of jet density, free-stream density, jet velocity, jet temperature, free-stream velocity, and orifice flow coefficient.

Improvements in Heat Transfer for Anti-Icing of Gas-Heated Airfoils with Internal Fins and Partitions.

Abstract  
The effectiveness of internal finning in airfoils was analyzed to determine design variables by which local surface heat transfer may be efficiently controlled. Comparative investigations of gas-heated hollow airfoils indicate that surface-heating rates for ice prevention may be increased up to 3.5 times by the addition of metal fins and flow-confining partitions to the airfoil internal passage.

ANALOGY BETWEEN MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER WITH TURBULENT FLOW.  
Edmund E. Callaghan. October 1953. 19p. diagrs. (NACA TN 3045)  
An analysis of combined heat and mass transfer from a flat plate has been made in terms of Prandtl's simplified physical concept of the turbulent boundary layer. The results of the analysis show that for conditions of reasonably small heat and mass transfer, the ratio of the mass- and heat-transfer coefficients is dependent on the Reynolds number of the boundary layer, the Prandtl number of the medium of diffusion, and the Schmidt number of the diffusing fluid in the medium of diffusion. For the particular case of water evaporating into air, the ratio of mass-transfer coefficient to heat-transfer coefficient is found to be slightly greater than unity.

Willard D. Coles and Robert S. Ruggeri. March 1954. 29p. diagrs., photo. (NACA TN 3104)  
An experimental investigation was conducted in the 3.84- by 10-inch tunnel to determine the mass transfer by sublimation, heat transfer, and skin friction for an iced surface at subsonic and supersonic speeds. The results show that the Stanton numbers of sublimation and heat transfer were increased 40 to 50 percent for an iced surface of moderate roughness as compared with those obtained for a bare plate. For ice surfaces of equivalent roughness, the ratio of sublimation to heat-transfer Stanton numbers was found to be 0.90. Sublimation Stanton numbers obtained at a Mach number of 1.3 showed no appreciable deviation from those obtained at subsonic speeds. Sublimation as a means of removing ice formations of appreciable thickness is so slow as to be of little value in the de-icing of aircraft at high altitudes.

The thermal conductivity or low-density ice has been computed from data obtained in an experimental investigation of the heat transfer and mass transfer by sublimation for an iced surface on a flat plate in a high-velocity tangential airstream. The results are compared with data from several sources on the thermal conductivity of packed snow and solid glaze ice. The results show good agreement with the packed-snow values, and the extension of the curves for packed snow to the solid ice regime indicates that the curves are applicable to ice over the entire density range.

Variation of wet-surface temperature and the conditions that will result in ice-free surfaces for high-speed flight through clouds were investigated experimentally. The results are compared with calculated values obtained with an analytical method. The analytical results were generally conservative, giving wet-surface temperatures 20 to 40 F lower than the experiments and predicting the formation of ice at values of ambient-air temperature up to 120 F higher than the experiments. The location of analytically determined critical regions on the bodies for the initial formation of ice was experimentally substantiated.

The convective heat-transfer coefficients were determined for an ellipsoidal spinner of 30-inch maximum diameter for both stationary and rotating operation. The range of conditions studied included air-speeds up to 275 miles per hour, rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm, and angles of attack of zero and 4°. The results indicate that a higher heat transfer occurred with rotation of the spinner. Transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurred over a large range of Reynolds numbers primarily because of surface roughness of the spinner.

CORRELATION OF AIRFOIL ICE FORMATIONS AND THEIR AERODYNAMIC EFFECTS WITH IMPINGEMENT AND FLIGHT CONDITIONS  
Vernon H. Gray  
ABSTRACT  
An empirical equation is developed by which changes in drag coefficients due to ice formations on an NACA 65A004 airfoil may be calculated from known icing and flight conditions; this equation is then extended to include available data for other airfoils up to 15-percent thickness ratio. The correlation was obtained primarily by use of ice heights and ice angles measured on the 4-percent thick airfoil. The final equation, however, does not include the ice measurements, but relates changes in drag coefficients due to ice with the following variables: icing time, airspeed, air temperature, liquid-water content, cloud droplet-impingement efficiencies, airfoil chord, angles of attack, and leading-edge radius-of-curvature.  
Changes in lift and pitching-moment coefficients due to ice on an NACA 0011 airfoil are also related to the corresponding changrs in drag coefficients; additional data on lift and pitching-moment changes due to ice are limited to the 65A004 airfoil, for which complex trends preclude a relationship within the scope of this paper.

THE ICING PROBLEM CURRENT STATUS OF NACA TECHNIQUES AND RESEARCH  
Uwe H. von Glahn  
ABSTRACT  
Icing of aircraft components such as airfoil surfaces and engine-inlet systems creates a serious operational problem. Aircraft are now capable of flying in icing clouds without difficulty, however, because research by the NACA and others has provided the engineering basis for icing protection systems. This paper summarizes some of the techniques used in NACA programs to solve aircraft icing problems and indicates the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing protection systems. The NACA Lewis icing facilities, specific test equipment and techniques used in conducting tests in icing wind tunnels, and several icing instruments are discussed in detail.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS OF THE NEED FOR ICING PROTECTION OF HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRPLANES  
Uwe von Glahn  
SUMMARY  
The icing problems of high-speed, high-altitude aircraft are confined to climb and let-down conditions. The performance losses in icing can be minimized by the use of an icing protection system at the expense of structural complexities and installed weight. The elimination of airframe protection systems for aircraft subject only to short icing encounters appears attractive, provided the performance penalty due to icing is not excessive. This paper considers the performance penalty caused by icing during climb in terms of reduction in rate of climb and in range for aircraft without airframe icing protection and is intended to show only orders of magnitude rather than absolute values.

A FLIGHT EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF ICING CONDITIONS ON THE ZPG-Z AIRSHIP.  
William Lewis and Porter J. Perkins, Jr. April 1958. 66p. diagrs., photos, tab. (NACA TN 4220)  
Test flights conducted by the U. S. Navy in a number of typical icing conditions are described. The airship operated successfully in all icing conditions encountered, but the desirability of limited protection for certain components was indicated. Icing in clouds was confined to wires and small components, but freezing rain and drizzle produced some icing on the envelope also. Theoretical calculations are presented which suggest that, while hazardous icing in freezing rain can occur under certain meteorological conditions, the probability of encountering these conditions is very small in coastal areas and approaches zero 200 to 300 miles offshore.

ICING CONDITIONS TO BE EXPECTED IN THE OPERATION OF HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRPLANES  
William Lewis  
SUMMARY  
This paper considers the specific problems concerned with the prot- able frequency and severity of icing conditions to be expected in the operation of high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, as compared with the icing conditions encountered on older types of aircraft. There are two general aspects of this problem. The first phase of this discussion will be concerned with the frequency and probably severity of icing conditions at high altitudes. High-altitude airplanes, however, must still climb and descend through the lower layers of the atmosphere where icing conditions are more frequent; therefore, the second phase of this discussion will deal with the effect of aerodynamic heating, due to high airspeed, on the icing potentialities of clouds encountered at low altitudes.

HEAT REQUIREMENTS FOR ICE PREVENTION ON GAS-HEATED PROPELLERS  
V. H. Gray  
SUMMARY  
The investigation has established that feasible rates of heated gas flow can provide ample surface heating of propeller blades except at the leading edge, where complete ice prevention requires large rates of gas flow, resulting in considerable wastage of heat elsewhere in the blade and at the discharge nozzle. This waste heat can be reduced to a small fraction of its original value by carefully designing the blade internal passage so that use is made of flow-confining partitions and metal fins attached at the blade leading edge.

aeronautical engineer desiring to adequately protect an aircraft designed for flight in icing conditions. 
The report is divided into six sections. The first discusses statistical icing data to be used as design criteria 
for ice protection evaluations and systems. The second section is concerned with the physics of ice collection, 
and presents formulas and charts for determinations of the rate, size, and shape of ice 
formations on aircraft. The third section discusses the known methods of ice protection, 
and presents formulas and data to be used in design. 
The fourth section shows specific and typical applications of ice protection systems to 
light and heavy aircraft. 
The fifth section presents data on detection of icing by visual means and by ice detector and 
indicator systems. The final section discusses the various methods of testing aircraft for adequacy 
of icing protection with and without ice protection systems. 
Included are data on icing tunnel testing, dry air flight testing, flight testing in natural icing, 
and flight in simulated icing.
