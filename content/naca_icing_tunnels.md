>Certain preliminary tests were made in the wind tunnel to
determine the best form of water spray necessary to produce ice
of smooth appearance and which would be similar in structure
and form to that observed in flight (Reference 12 ), in order to
make a study of possible preventives.
It was found that the
character of the formations obtained depended to a great degree
on the quantity of water admitted to the tunnel per unit of time.
A spray which consisted of large drops was found to use excessive
quantities of water which could not be properly regulated without 
giving very poor dispersion in the jet, and which gave formations 
of ice on the model of a very different shape from any
obtained in flight.
A spray, which consisted of very small
drops, was found to be quite satisfactory and was used in all
the following tests, as it could be easily controlled to give
even dispersion across the air stream at any desired rate of
water output.

>The amount of water present in the wind tunnel jet was measured 
roughly to determine the actual density of the spray used
in the tests.
These measurements were compared with meteorological tables, 
and indicate that the spray density used in the
first series of tests,
which was about 2000 milligrams of liquid
water per cubic meter of air, corresponds to
excessive rain.
Similarly, the density used in the second series, which was
about 500 milligrams per cubic meter, corresponds with figures
for a moderate to heavy rain.
It is believed that the latter 
density represents more closely average ice-forming weather conditions.

>Natural precipitations were simulated by admitting
water to the air stream through a spray nozzle.
The tunnel test section with the model and the spray are diagrammatically shown in figure 1.

>The range of control over the formation of ice was
such that a simulation of all typical ice formations
found in flight could be produced.
