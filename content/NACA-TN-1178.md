## Abstract  

>The thermal performance of an air-heated propeller, installed on a
test airplane, was evaluated by observations of the ice-prevention properties 
of the propeller during flight in natural-icing conditions and by
the collection of thermal data on the propeller during flight in clear
air and in clouds at temperatures above freezing. The test propeller
was equipped with hollow steel blades of a standard design which were
altered to permit heated air to enter the blade cavities at the propeller
hub and to leave the cavities at the blade tips. No provisions were
made to control the distribution of air flow inside the blades.  
> 
>The observations in natural-icing conditions together with the thermal 
test data indicate that little or no protection to the leading-edge
region of the propeller blades would result during flight in severe
natural-icing conditions. The observations in natural-icing conditions
were limited in that only light-icing conditions were encountered; however, 
in these light-icing conditions ice accretions formed on the leading 
edges of the blades in the region of blade stations 30 to 40. The
clear air and cloud tests showed the propeller blades to be inefficient
heat exchangers in that more heat energy was discharged in the air flow
leaving the propeller than was dissipated through the propeller-blade
surfaces. The measured blade-surface temperatures indicated that inadequate 
heating was provided to the leading-edge region of the propeller and 
show the need of providing means to increase the heat flow
through the leading-edge region of the blades.

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
>During the past few years, research has been directed to provide
protection for aircraft propellers during flight in natural-icing
conditions by the application of heat to the propeller blades. One
means of a~plying heat has been through the use of electrically heated,
rubber blade shoes placed over the leading edges of the propeller blades
(reference 1). These shoes, however, in their present state of development 
have some effect (although small) on the aerodynamic performance of
the propeller, require frequent servicing, and require the availability
of a suitable electrical power supply. In an attempt to provide a more
simple system, and make use of the heat content of the airplane engine
exhaust gases, one of the well known propeller manufacturers constructed
an air-heated propeller. This propeller was equipped with hollow steel
blades of a standard design. It had provisions for inducting heated air
into the blade cavities at the propeller hub and of disposing of it
through discharge nozzles located at the blade tips. No provisions were
made for controlling the distribution of the heated air in the blade
interiors.  
> 
>The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the thermal
performance of this alr-heated propeller. The investigation consisted
of flight tests in natural-icing conditions during which the ice-protection 
properties of the propeller were observed and flight tests in clear
air and in clouds at temperatures above freezing during which thermal
data on the propeller were obtained.  
> 
>The investigation was conducted by the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory
of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The flights in
natural-icing conditions were conducted from the Army Air Forces Ice Research Base, 
Minneapolis, Minn., during the winter 1944-45; and the remainder of 
the tests were conducted at the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory,
Moffett Field, Calif., in the summer of 1945.  

>DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT  
> 
>The test propeller, a four-blade, 14-foot-diameter, air-heated propeller 
was installed on the left engine of a test airplane. A similar
installation, which was provided on the right engine for subsequent tests,
is shown in figure 1.

>The operation of the propeller heating system is
shown in figures 2 and 3.

>Ram air, heated by an exhaust-gas-air heat exchanger installation 
(described in reference 2) was ducted to the
stationary part of the propeller air manifold. The heated air was then
transmitted to the rotating part of the propeller air manifold, admitted
to the blade cavity through holes in the blade shanks, and discharged
through nozzles located at the blade tips. The air particles in the
blade are subject to radial accelerations, due to the rotation of the propeller, 
which results in a pumping action. This pumping action together
with the ram pressure at the heat exchanger induced the air flow
through the system. In order to reduce the air leakage between the
stationary and rotating parts of the propeller air manifold, and between 
the blade shanks and the rotating part of the propeller air manifold, 
carbon seals were provided as shown in figure 3. Tne approximate
propeller-blade sections and a sketch of the propeller-tip discharge
nozzles are given in figures 4 and 5, respectively. As employed herein,
the term "station" denotes the radial distance from the center of rotation 
in inches. (See fig. 4.)

>TESTS  
> 
>For the flights in natural-icing conditions, the airplane was
operated at the cruise conditions of 950 to 1000 propeller rpm (1900 to
2000 engine rpm) and indicated airspeeds of 150 to 160 miles per hour.
During these tests measurements were made of the temperature and the
rate of air flow delivered to the propeller. At all times the flow
rate to the propeller was the maximum obtainable for the operating conditions. 
Visual and photographic observations were made of the ice-protection 
qualities of the propeller.  
> 
>At the close of the period during which natural-icing conditions
prevailed, the instrumentation on the rotating part of the propeller
installation was installed and flight tests were undertaken in clear
air and in clouds above freezing to obtain thermal data on the propeller. 
The tests were conducted at 2700 to 3900 feet pressure altitude, 
160 miles per hour indicated airspeed, 950 propeller rpm, with a
maximum rate of air flow to the propeller. These test conditions were
established as being comparable to the operating conditions during the
icing flights.  
> 
>Measurements of the instrumented blade surface and tip air temperatures, 
as well as measurements of the heated-air-flow rates and the
temperature of the air entering the propeller were recorded for these
tests. One test run was made with the heated-air supply duct disconnected 
from the heat exchanger, and the propeller pumping free-stream
air, in order to obtain an indication of the propeller-blade surface-temperature 
rises caused by adiabatic and friction heating resulting
from the external and internal air flows.  

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
> 
>The observations made during flight in natural-icing conditions are
presented in table I. 

![Table I. OBSERVATIONS OF AIR-HEATED PROPELLER DURING FLIGHT IN LIGHT-ICING CONDITIONS](images%2FNACA-TN-1178%2FTable%20I.png)  

>These observations were limited in that only
light-icing conditions were encountered. Light-icing conditions are defined 
as those in which an unprotected airplane could sustain flight
almost indefinitely. These results show, however, that even in these
light-icing conditions, ice accumulated on the leading edge of the propeller 
blades in the region of stations 30 to 40 as shown in figure 9.
No ice formation on the blades aft of the leading-edge regions was observed 
during the tests.

> The blade-surface temperatures of table II have been plotted as
temperature distributions in figure 10. The temperature distribution
(above ambient-air temperature) obtained during the dry-air tests with
heated air flow to the propeller is shown in figure 10(a).  

![Figure 10a.png](images%2FNACA-TN-1178%2FFigure%2010a.png)

>In figure 10(c) the mean curve of figure 10(a) is compared with the
data obtained during flight in clouds. In this plot, the cloud data
have been plotted as actual temperatures and the curve of figure 10(a)
has been placed with respect to the ambient-air temperature of the cloud
test. This method of plotting was used because the factors of wet-air
kinetic heating of the blade surfaces and evaporization of water from
the blade surfaces are dependent on the actual surface temperatures of
the blade. A detailed discussion of these factors is presented for a
wing surface in reference 4. The data obtained in the clouds provided
no temperature data beyond blade station 57. Also included in this
figure is a plot of the theoretical leading edge temperatures due to
kinetic heating based on equation 2 using wet air values of cpo This
figure shows that the temperature rise of the blade due to air heating
diminished to practically zero at station 57. The leading edge temperature 
rises above ambient air temperature shown in this figure are very
low (less than 10Â° F from station 35 to 57). This accounts for the fact
that ice was observed to form on the leading edge regions of the propeller 
blades during flight in light natural icing conditions.

>Application of the analysis of reference 4 to the present tests indicates 
that the blade-surface temperature rises above ambient-air temperature 
during the flights in light-icing conditions were probably greater
than those experienced during the flight in clouds because the lower
ambient temperature in the former tests would result in increased kinetic 
heating (lower cp) and a reduction in evaporative cooling.
> 
> The teat data indicate that the temperature rise of the leading
edges of the propeller blades could be expected to provide only limited
ice prevention in flight-natural-icing conditions and therefore it may be
concluded that little or no protection would be provided to the leading-edge 
regions of the blades in severe icing conditions.

## Conclusions  

>The results of the thermal performance tests of an air-heated
propeller indicate the following:  
>1. The air-heated-propeller installation tested would offer little
or no protection to the leading-edge regions of the propeller during
flight in severe natural-icing conditions.  
>2. The surface-temperature distribution is undesirable, and means
should be provided to concentrate the heat in the leading-edge regions
of the blades.  

Complete ice protection for hot-air heated propeller blades was not achieved in this study.
