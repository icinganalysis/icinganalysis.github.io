> An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the
penetration of a circular air jet directed perpendicularly to an
air strewn as a function of jet density, jet velocity, air-stream
density, air-stream velocity, jet diameter, and distance downstream
from the jet. The penetration was determined for nearly constant
values of air-stream density at two tunnel velocities, four jet
diameters, four positions downstream of the jet, and for a large
range of jet velocities and densities. An equation for the 
penetration was obtained in terms of the jet diameter, the distance
downstream from the jet, and the ratios of jet and. air-stream
velocities and densities.

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION
The introduction of a gas or vapor into an air stream for the
purpose of heating the air stream by mixing or burning often necessitates 
rapid mixing of the gas or the vapor with the air stream.
The high degree of turbulence created by a jet directed perpendicularly 
to an air stream offers a means of obtaining satisfactory
mixing. The jet must rapidly penetrate the air stream in order
that this mixing be accomplished in a short distance. One method
of obtaining adequate penetration is the utilization of the kinetic
energy of a high-velocity jet.  
>
>An investigation to determine the penetration of a high-velocity 
circular air jet directed perpendicularly to an air stream
was undertaken in a 2- by 20-inch-duct tunnel at the NACA Cleveland
laboratory. The penetration at several positions downstream of the
jet was determined at tunnel velocities of 260 and 360 feet per
second for four jet (orifice) diameters and a range of orifice
pressure drops from 5 to 50 inches of mercury.

>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE  
>
>The experimental investigation consisted of two parts:  
(1) calibration of the orifices, and  
(2) measurements of the depth at penetration of the jets.   
> 
>Calibration of orifices. - Four thin-plate orifices, 1/16 inch
thick and 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, and 0.625 inch in diameter, were
calibrated in still air and the total-pressure distribution at the
orifice plane for each jet was determined for a range of 
static-pressure drops across the orifice.  
> 
>Measurement of depth of penetration. - The penetration of the
jet Into the air stream was measured at four positions downstream
at the orifice center line. At the rearmost position, 20.25 inches
downstream, a permanent rake was used that consisted of 22 
total-pressure tubes and 22 thermocouples alternately spaced 1/2 inch
apart. An adjustable rake consisting at 24 thermocouples spaced
on 1/4-inch centers was used to measure the penetration 4.63, 7.94,
and 14.19 inches downstream of the orifice center line. At each
position of the adjustable rake, the jet penetrations were investigated 
for a range of static-pressure drops from 5 to 50 inches
of mercury at tunnel velocities of approximately 260 and 360 feet
per second for nearly constant values of air-stream density.
In order to facilitate the determination of the penetration,
heated air for the jet was supplied at approximately 400° F by
passing the air through an electric heater. From the heater, the
air was passed into a plenum chamber, the upper wall of which contained 
the jet orifice, as shown in figure 1.

the pressure data were photographed from a multiple manometer.

>METHODS OF CALCULATION  
> 
>The total-pressure distribution across the orifices indicated
a uniform total pressure for a large part of the diameter, as
shown in figure 2.   

![Figure 2.  Typical total-pressure profile or jet.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FFigure%202.png)  

> Because of this uniform distribution, the jet
velocity Vi was based on the maximum total pressure. The
velocity Vj and the density ρj at the vena contracta, or minimum 
section,were determined with the compressible-flow relations
for the subsonic or unchoked condition.  
> 
>When the static-pressure ratio across the orifice exceeded
that necessary for choking, the jet velocity at the vena contracta
equalled the local speed of sound in the heated air. The jet
velocity at the vena contracta for this case was determined from
the following equation:  
![Equation 1.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FEquation%201.png)  

>The jet velocity for the choked condition was determined from
the total temperature and the total pressure by using the following
equation:  
![Equation 2.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FEquation%202.png)  

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
> 
>A simple dimensional analysis involving the known variables
was made and the following result obtained:  
![Equation 3.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FEquation%203.png)  

>In order to evaluate the penetration from the temperature
profiles, it was necessary to define the penetration as the point
at which the temperature is 1° F above the free-stream total 
temperature. This arbitrary assumption was made because of the 
difficulty 
encountered in determining the exact point at which the
temperature returned to free-stream total temperature owing to the
rapid change in curvature of the profiles near this point, as
shown in figure 3. The variation in the maximum temperature rise
of the various curves is caused by the change in jet-air 
temperature and the change in jet mass flow.

>In order to simplify the analysis of the data, it was necessary 
to consider the data in terms of a single jet diameter and a
single rake position. Thus the mixing distance-diameter ratio
s/Dj 
and the width coefficient w/Dj became constant. In addition, 
because the jet temperatures were nearly constant, the
variation of the viscosity ratio μj/μo was very small and its
effect was not considered. In this way, all the parameters except
the density ratio ρj/ρ0, the velocity ratio Vj/Vo, and the jet 
Reynolds number ρj Vj Dj / μj
were eliminated. The penetration coefficient l/Dj was plotted as 
a function of the product of the
density and velocity ratios and a single curve was obtained.  
> 
>Because no consistent trend in these data could be observed, the
effect of jet Reynolds number was considered to be small. Similar
plots for other values of the jet diameter at the same rake position 
yielded a family of curves. The family of curves obtained
at the 7.94-inch rake station for the four values of jet diameter
are shown in figure 4.

velocity and density ratios for various jet diameters. Distance
downstream from jet s, 7.94 inches.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FFigure%204.png)  

>Further analysis of this figure indicated
that the member curves were separated. by a factor that was equal
to (1/Dj)^0.5. It was therefore possible to plot penetration 
coefficient against the product of the density ratio, velocity ratio,
and the previously determined factor (1/Dj)^0.5 and to obtain a
single curve.  
> 
> A similar procedure was followed for the remaining rake stations 
and a single curve was obtained for each rake position by
using the same parameters and factor. It was not obvious, however, 
whether the width coefficient or the mixing distance -
diameter ratio was the primary variable separating the curves
because both the width and the distance downstream were constant.
When these plots were combined, the family of curves shown in
figure 5 was obtained.  

![Figure 5. Variation of penetration coefficient with parameter 
for various values of s.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FFigure%205.png)  

>Because the width was invariable, the
mixing distance was assumed to be the primary variable separating
the curves. A plot of the penetration coefficient against the
product of the velocity ratio, density ratio, and the square root
of the mixing distance - diameter ratio was constructed and a
single curve was obtained (fig. 6). Because no consistent
scatter could be observed in the data, the effect of viscosity
ratio and jet Reynolds number for-all-the jets is indicated
to be small for a range of viscosity ratios from 1.5 to 1.9
and jet Reynolds numbers from 60,000 to 500,000 .

![Figure 6. Variation of penetration coefficient with penetration parameter.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FFigure%206.png)  

>A factor that probably increased depth of penetration in
these experiments is the confining effect of the tunnel walls.
For a range of width coefficients from 3.2 to 8.0, however, no
effect could be found.  
> 
>An equation that fitted the experimental curve of Figure 4
has been obtained:  

![Equation 4.png](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FEquation%204.png)

>Curves of the mixing distance - diameter ratio as a function
of the penetration coefficient for constant' values of the product
of the density and velocity ratios as obtained from this equation
are shown in figure 7. These curves indicate the actual shape of
the penetration boundary.

## Conclusions  

>From an investigation to determine the penetration of an air
jet directed perpendicularly to an air stream, the following
results were obtained:  
>1. The following empirical equation was determined for the
penetration coefficient-in terms of the density ratio, the velocity
ratio, and the mixing distance - diameter ratio:  
![Equation 4.png](/images%2FNACA-TN-1615%2FEquation%204.png)  
where l is depth of jet penetration into air stream at distance s
downstream from orifice center line; Dj, orifice diameter; ρj, mass
density of jet air at vena contracta; ρo, mass density of free-stream air; 
Vj, velocity of jet at vena contracta; 
and Vo, velocity of free stream.  
>2. The variation of penetration coefficient with jet Reynolds
number, width coefficient, and viscosity ratio was found to be
negligible for a range of jet Reynolds numbers from 60,000 to
500,000, a range of width coefficients from 3.2 to 3.0, and a
range of viscosity ratios from 1.5 to 1.9.
