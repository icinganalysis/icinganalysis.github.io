## Abstract  

>The icing characteristics of two typical light-airplane engine
induction systems were investigated using the carburetors and manifolds 
of engines in the horsepower ranges from 65 to 85 and 165 to 185. 
The smaller system consisted of a float-type carburetor with
an unheated manifold and the larger system consisted of a single-barrel 
pressure-type carburetor with an oil-jacketed manifold.
Carburetor-air temperature and humidity limits of visible and
serious icing were determined for various engine power conditions.
Several methods of achieving ice-free induction systems are discussed 
along with estimates of surface heating requirements of the
various induction-system components.
> 
> A study was also made of the icing characteristics of a typical
light-airplane air scoop with an exposed filter and a modified
system that provided a normal ram inlet with the filter located in
a position to Induce inertia separation of the free water from the
charge air.
> 
> The principle of operation of float-type carburetors is proved
to make them inherently more susceptible to icing at the throttle
plate than pressure-type carburetors. The results indicated that proper
jacketing and heating of all parts exposed to the fuel spray can
satisfactorily reduce or eliminate icing in the float-type carburetor
and the manifold. Pressure-type carburetors can be protected from
serious Icing by proper location of the fuel-discharge nozzle combined 
with suitable application of heat to critical parts.

## Discussion  

Text extracts and figures were selected to illustrate the conclusions.  

> INTRODUCTION  
> 
> Increased use of small privately owned airplanes in recent years
and the possibility of very widespread use in the future has made
the safe operation of these airplanes in any atmospheric condition of
great importance. Safety in flight can be improved by reducing the
number of items that require pilot attention and judgment, one of
the most important considerations being the prevention of ice formation 
in the induction system. Most of the aircraft in the light-airplane class 
currently depend on pilot operation of a carburetor-heat 
control valve to prevent icing during flight at cruise power
when the outside air temperature is below approximately 65° F and
during glide-power operation at all air temperatures.  
> 
> Icing characteristics of large engine induction systems used on
commercial and military aircraft have been investigated (references 1
to 4) and modifications were suggested to the extent that trouble-free 
operation can be achieved under nearly all atmospheric conditions.  

>A broad investigation of the icing characteristics of various
airplane induction systems was conducted at the NACA Lewis laboratory 
to determine the extent of induction-system icing in typical
light airplanes, together with possible methods of reducing or
eliminating icing by modification or improved design, and to
establish a satisfactory safety guide for the use of anti-Icing
equipment.  
> 
> A typical light-airplane induction system consists of a ram-air
inlet, a filter, alternate exhaust-heated air supply, a float-type
carburetor, and an unheated manifold connected by intake pipes to
the cylinders. Some manufacturers supply pressure-type carburetors,
oil-jacketed manifolds, or low-pressure fuel-injection systems on
the larger engines and also on the smaller engines as optional
equipment.  
> 
> For simplicity, only the carburetors and the manifolds of the
engines were used in the light-airplane engine carburetor-icing
Investigation reported herein and an exhauster system was employed
to induce proper air flow and to provide necessary manifold-pressure
conditions. Impact icing of light-airplane filters, which are
usually mounted either flush with the front of the engine cowling or
recessed a few inches into the inlet, was studied In the NACA
Lewis icing research tunnel. A direct ram-air inlet with exposed
filter is compared with a ram-air inlet that houses a submerged
filter to induce inertia separation of water droplets from the
carburetor air.

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
> 
> Float-Type Carburetor  
> 
> The limits of visible icing and serious icing at various float-type 
carburetor-air temperatures and humidity ratios for high-cruise,
low-cruise, and glide power conditions are shown In figure 5. These
data demonstrate the critical effect of throttle opening on icing in
the carburetor by the Increase In the visible- and serious-icing
ranges as the power (and throttle angle) is decreased. At high-cruise 
power, the upper limit of visible Icing occurs at a carburetor-air 
temperature of approximately 62° F, whereas at low-cruise and
glide powers the upper limits occur at approximately 70° and 93° F,
respectively. (Visible icing at glide power Is designated serious.)
For high-cruise, low-cruise, and glide power conditions, the upper limits
of air temperature for serious icing are 620,630, and 930 F,and the lower
limits of relative humidity are 80, 60, and 30 percent, respectively.

>Air-Scoop and Filter Icing  
> 
> The results of an effort to eliminate impact icing on light-airplane 
air scoops and filters by means of a design to induce
inertia separation of the water droplets from the Intake air are
shown in figure 7 for two air-scoop and filter combinations. The
time required to cause an air-flow reduction of 25 percent by the
formation of ice on the filter for tunnel-air temperatures from
17° to 22° F is used as a basis of comparison of the two systems in
the following table:

simulated-icing conditions. Tunnel-air temperature, 17° to 22° F; air velocity,
80 miles per hour.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1790%2FFigure%207.png)  

> Experience indicates that most current induction systems with
an alternate supply of heated unfiltered air will allow flight In
Impact-icing conditions so long as other parts of the airplane can
endure icing, if proper judgment is exercised by the pilot in operating 
the heated-air system.

> A simple inertia-separation system will not satisfactorily
eliminate impact icing on inlet filters because of the low air velocities. 
A sheltered air inlet taking alternate air from the engine
compartment will provide satisfactory protection from impact icing
on the filter. Because light-airplane intake systems produce very
little ram pressure, the loss in engine power resulting from such a
change would be insignificant.

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
> 
> From an investigation of the icing characteristics of light-airplane 
engine induction systems conducted on laboratory installations 
of carburetors and manifolds, air scoops, and filters, the
following results were obtained:  
> 
> Float-Type Carburetor  
>1. Serious icing occurred up to carburetor-air temperatures
of 62° , 63°, and 93° F and the lower limits of relative humidity
were 80, 60, and 30 percent, for high-cruise, low-cruise and glide
power conditions, respectively.  
>2. The carburetor was susceptible to icing at the throttle
plate and on the throttle body around the idle discharge holes, and
the manifold iced primarily in the vertical riser.  
>3. The formation of heavy ice in the carburetor and manifold
resulted in air-flow reduction, which could not be regained by
opening the throttle to the wide-open position.  
>4. A jacketed manifold and throttle body and a heated throttle
plate provided complete anti-icing protection at high-cruise power
with saturated carburetor air at 35° F. using a heating medium that
supplied approximately 2000 Btu per hour, of which approximately
800 Btu per hour were required for the throttle plate and the balance
was approximately equally divided between the throttle body and the
manifold.  

>Pressure-Type Carburetor  
>1. Serious icing occurred between carburetor-air temperatures
of 48° and 55° F with relative humidities from 90 to 100 percent at
low-cruise power and up to approximately 75° F with relative humidities
greater than 32 percent at glide power. No serious icing occurred
at the high-cruise power condition.  
>2. The throttle plate was completely free of ice at low-cruise
power, but eddying of the fuel spray caused serious icing of the
throttle plate at glide power with several instances of extremely
rich fuel-air ratios occurring because fuel metering in the idle
range is governed by throttle position rather than air flow.  
>3. Throttling icing with carburetor air at or below saturation
was negligible.  
>4. The oil-jacketed manifold with an oil flow and inlet temperature 
typical of operating conditions prevented serious icing at
low-cruise power and confined visible manifold icing to carburetor-air 
temperatures below 60° F. At glide power the heated manifold did
not prevent serious icing of the throttle plate.  

>Air-Scoop and Filter Icing  
>1. Inertia separation of water droplets in the order of 10 microns
in diameter from the inlet-air stream appeared to be impractical for
light-airplane induction systems because of the low air velocities.  
>2. For both the standard and modified air scoops, icing conditions 
in which a large percentage of small droplets existed caused
more rapid blocking of the filter than icing conditions in which
large droplets were predominate.
