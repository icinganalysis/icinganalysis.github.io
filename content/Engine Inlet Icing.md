### _"The desirability for all-weather operation of turbojet aircraft has necessitated extensive research on methods of icing protection for the various engine components"_

## Discussion  

Publications taken largely from 
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications](The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md),
"Turbine-Type Engine and Inlet Icing Studies" section are reviewed here.

However, this was largely a preliminary version of [NACA-TN-3837]({filename}NACA-TN-3837.md) "Investigation of Heat Transfer from a Stationary and Rotating Ellipsoidal Forebody of Fineness Ratio 3", 
and so it will not be separately reviewed.
