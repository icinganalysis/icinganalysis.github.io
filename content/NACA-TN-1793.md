# "Investigation of Meteorological Conditions Associated with Aircraft Icing in Layer-Type Clouds for 1947-48 Winter"  

>SUMMARY  
Rotating-cylinder
measurements of the icing conditions encountered
in flight during the winter of 1947-48 are presented. Liquid-water 
content,drop size,and temperature edata are shown to be consistent 
with previously measured conditions and with proposed
maximum icing conditions in supercooled layer-type clouds. 
Cumulative-frequency graphs of meteorological
parameters indicate the frequency
with which various icing conditions have been encountered in the
Great Lakes area and surrounding states.

> INTRODUCTION  
One of the problems closely associated with the development of
adequate and practicable thermal ice-prevention equipment for airplanes
is the determination of the range of the pertinent meteorological
variables that occur in icing conditions likely to be
encountered during flight. One phase of the basic research on aircraft 
icing problems conducted by the NACA has therefore been an attempt to 
find and to fly in natural icing conditions for the
purpose of measuring the meteorological
factors associated with
supercooled clouds.
Complete information concerning the fundamental physical
processes that determine
the structure of clouds and cloud systems
has necessitated a statistical approach to the problem. The 
accumulation of considerable meteorological
data over differing geographical
and climatological regions in various weather conditions is
therefore required before the design limits for ice-prevention
systems can be stated with reasonable certainty. 
> 
> Comparison of Data with Proposed Design Conditions  
Tentative estimates of the most severe icing conditions likely
to be encountered in flight are contained in reference 4. The
values for stratus and stratocumulus clouds are:  

| Liquid-water content (gm/cu m) | Temperature (°F) | Mean-effective drop diameter (microns) |
|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0.8                            | 20               | 15                                     |
| 0.5                            | 20               | 25                                     |

Reference 4 is NACA-TN-1393. We will discuss NACA-TN-1393 further below.  

>Examination
of table I and figure 1 indicates that these proposed maximum conditions
were neither equalled nor exceeded during
the 1947-48 season. Whereas the first cylinder run of ice condltions 
approximates
the estimated maximum conditions with respect
to liquid-water content and temperature,
the decreased collection
efficiency of exposed airfoil surfaces due to the small drops 
considerably lessened the rate of ice formation.

>Frequency-Distribution of Meteorological Parameters  
During the two seasons of ice flights from the Lewis laboratory, 
31 flights were made in icing conditions during which
93 rotating-cylinder observations were collected. Nearly all the
data were gathered in layer-type clouds, including nine observations
in alto-stratus. Owing to the procedure of attempting to find, and
to fly as long as possible, in the heavier-icing conditions, the
data are believed to be weighted in favor of the more severe conditions 
that existed in the Great Lakes area and surrounding states.
An ogive (emulative-frequency curve) based on observations of
liquid-water content during the 1946-47 and 1947-48 seasons is shown
in figure 2. A liquid-water content of less than 0.40 gram per cubic
meter was measured in nearly 90 percent of the cases and 50 percent
of all observations were made in conditions with less than 0.18 gram
per cubic meter.

>The ogive of drop-size measurements in figure 3 indicates that
about 90 percent of the measurements of mean-effeative
diameter of
the drops in icing clouds were less than 20 microns and 50 percent
were less than 13 microns.

>Because the actual icing intensity observed in flight is related
to both the concentration of supercooled
water and the drop sizes,
computations
have been made of the theoretical rate of ice accretion
on a 3-inch-diameter
cylinder, which roughly approximates
the leading edge of at least part of an airplane wing. Although no simple
measure
of icing intensity is adequate for engineering purposes,
the use of a 3-inch cylinder as a reference for icing-intensity
measurements relates the observations to conditions that would
normally be observed by a pilot. Values for the collection efficiency
for a 3-inch cylinder for various drop sizes were taken from reference 6. 
Figure 4 indicates that 90 percent of all measured icing
conditions caused an icing rate of less than 3 grams per square centimeter 
per hour (1.5 in./hr, with an ice density of O.8). One-half
of the observations were in icing conditions of less than 1.3 grams
per square centimeter per hour (0.6 in./hr). The maximum condition
observed so far has been 5.3 grams per square centimeter per hour,
which is equivalent to about 2.6 inches per hour. The maximum
design conditions for layer-type clouds specified in reference 4 give
a computed icing rate of approximately 4 inches per hour when related
to a 3-inch-diameter cylinder.

and liquid-water content in icing clouds. Icing rate computation based on

> CONCLUSIONS  
The following general conclusions are based on the observations
gathered during two winter of icing flights from the Lewis laboratory:
>1. In supercooled layer clouds that exist over the Great Lakes area,
icing intensities are usually light (based upon the U. S.
Weather Bureau scale of icing intensity in reporting icing conditions
at mountain stations) but may occasionally approach an icing rate
of moderate intensity.
>2. Data collected during the two seasons indicate that the
Specifications of maximum  icing conditions in terms of liquid-water
content, mean-effective drop diameter, and temperature previously
proposed for supercooled layer-type clouds appear to be adequate
for the Great Lakes and surrounding regions.  




### NACA-TN-1393 "Tentative" Design Values  

We already saw the values in the [Icing on Cylinders Thread]({filename}Icing%20on%20Cylinders.md). 

> Analysis of the available observational data, supplemented by
considerations of the physical processes involved in the formation
of icing conditions has led to the following tentative estimates of
the most severe icing conditions likely to be encountered in the 
course of all-weather transport operations in the United States:

| Cloud type               | Duration             | Liquid water content | Average drop diameter | Temperature |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| cumulus                  | 1 minute             | 2.0 g/m^3            | 20 microns            | 0°F         |
| stratus or stratocumulus | 20 minutes or longer | 0.8 g/m^3            | 15 microns            | 20°F        |
| stratus or stratocumulus | 20 minutes or longer | 0.5 g/m^3            | 25 microns            | 20°F        |

The rationale for the stratus values is explained:  

> __Maximum continuous icing conditions__  
> The results of the fore-going discussion of the extent of icing 
> conditions as related to their intensity suggest a need to define 
> the maximum icing condition likely to occur over a large enough 
> area to make it necessary to provide for continuous operation in 
> this condition. This condition will exist in layer-type clouds 
> since cumulus clouds are by their nature discontinuous. 
> The maximum liquid water content observed in layer clouds during 
> this investigation was-about 0.7 gram per cubic meter, 
> which is the same as the maximum reported from the Army Air Forces 
> Ice Research Base at Minneapolis, Minn. These facts and the data in 
> figure 13 on the relation between liquid water content and duration 
> of flight in icing conditions suggest that a reasonable estimate of 
> the maximum water content likely to be encountered for periods of 
> 20 minutes or longer at a true airspeed of 160 miles per hour 
> would be approximately 0.8 gram per cubic meter. 
> Since this condition is expected to occur in layer clouds 
> (stratocumulus), a reasonable estimate of the concurrent values of 
> temperature and mean-effective drop diameter was made from an 
> examination of the data for layer clouds in figures 5 and 8. 
> The values chosen were 20° F and 15 microns.

For Figure 13 the argument appears to be reasonable:  
![fig 13 interpretation.](images%2Fnaca-tn-1393%2Ffig%2013%20interpretation.png)  

However, for Figure 5 the choice is not as clear:  
![fig 5 interpretation](images%2Fnaca-tn-1393%2Ffig%205%20interpretation.png)  

Also for Figure 8 the logic is not obvious:  
![fig 8 interpretation.png](images%2Fnaca-tn-1393%2Ffig%208%20interpretation.png)
