>SUMMARY  
Rotating-cylinder measurements of the icing conditions encountered 
in flight during the winter of 1947-48 are presented. Liquid-water 
content, drop size, and temperature data are shown to be consistent 
with previously measured conditions and with proposed 
maximum icing conditions in supercooled layer-type clouds. 
Cumulative-frequency graphs of meteorological 
parameters indicate the frequency 
with which various icing conditions have been encountered in the 
Great Lakes area and surrounding states.  

> INTRODUCTION  
>
>One of the problems closely associated with the development of 
adequate and practicable thermal ice-prevention equipment for airplanes 
is the determination of the range of the pertinent meteorological 
variables that occur in icing conditions likely to be 
encountered during flight. One phase of the basic research on aircraft 
icing problems conducted by the NACA has therefore been an attempt to 
find and to fly in natural icing conditions for the 
purpose of measuring the meteorological 
factors associated with supercooled clouds.  
> 
>Complete information concerning the fundamental physical 
processes that determine the structure of clouds and cloud systems 
has necessitated a statistical approach to the problem. The 
accumulation of considerable meteorological 
data over differing geographical 
and climatological regions in various weather conditions is 
therefore required before the design limits for ice-prevention 
systems can be stated with reasonable certainty.

>APPARATUS AND METHOD

>Rotating-Cylinder Measurements  
>
>Measurements of liquid water content, mean-effective drop 
diameter, and drop-size distribution were calculated from the 
weight of ice collected on each of four rotating aluminum cylinders
of 1/8, 1/2, 1 1/4, and 3-inch diameters. The procedure used to calculate 
the desired quantities was similar to that outlined in reference 6, 
except that a density of 0.8 was assumed for all be deposits 
in calculating the average cylinder diameter during the exposure 
period. Because of flight conditions, this procedure was used in 
place of the more tedious, but slightly more accurate, method of 
measurement of the thickness of the ice deposited on each cylinder.
For all computations the velocity in the vicinity of the cylinders. 
was assumed equal to the true airspeed of the airplane. Once a 
desired icing condition was encountered, as many runs as possible 
were made in order to approximate a continuous record of the cloud 
characteristics.

>Free Air Temperature  
> 
>Flight temperature measurements were made by means of a 
resistance-bulb thermometer shielded to eliminate radiation effects 
and direct impact of water. The thermometer was subject to kinetic 
heating because of the speed of the airplane. Corrections for the 
kinetic heating were obtained by the procedure outlined in reference 4.

>Tentative estimates of the most severe icing conditions likely 
to be encountered in flight are contained in reference 4. The 
values for stratus and stratocumulus clouds are:  

| Liquid-water content (gm/cu m) | Temperature (Â°F) | Mean-effective drop diameter (microns) |
|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0.8                            | 20               | 15                                     |
| 0.5                            | 20               | 25                                     |

Reference 4 is [NACA-TN-1393.md]({filename}NACA-TN-1393.md).  

>Examination 
of table I and figure 1 indicates that these proposed maximum conditions 
were neither equalled nor exceeded during 
the 1947-48 season. Whereas the first cylinder run of ice conditions 
approximates the estimated maximum conditions with respect 
to liquid-water content and temperature, the decreased collection 
efficiency of exposed airfoil surfaces due to the small drops 
considerably lessened the rate of ice formation.

>Frequency-Distribution of Meteorological Parameters  
>  
>During the two seasons of ice flights from the Lewis laboratory, 
31 flights were made in icing conditions during which 
93 rotating-cylinder observations were collected. Nearly all the 
data were gathered in layer-type clouds, including nine observations 
in alto-stratus. Owing to the procedure of attempting to find, and 
to fly as long as possible, in the heavier-icing conditions, the 
data are believed to be weighted in favor of the more severe conditions 
that existed in the Great Lakes area and surrounding states. 
An ogive (emulative-frequency curve) based on observations of 
liquid-water content during the 1946-47 and 1947-48 seasons is shown 
in figure 2. A liquid-water content of less than 0.40 gram per cubic 
meter was measured in nearly 90 percent of the cases and 50 percent 
of all observations were made in conditions with less than 0.18 gram 
per cubic meter.

>The ogive of drop-size measurements in figure 3 indicates that 
about 90 percent of the measurements of mean-effective 
diameter of 
the drops in icing clouds were less than 20 microns and 50 percent 
were less than 13 microns.

>Because the actual icing intensity observed in flight is related 
to both the concentration of supercooled 
water and the drop sizes, computations 
have been made of the theoretical rate of ice accretion 
on a 3-inch-diameter cylinder, which roughly approximates 
the leading edge of at least part of an airplane wing. Although no simple 
measure of icing intensity is adequate for engineering purposes, 
the use of a 3-inch cylinder as a reference for icing-intensity 
measurements relates the observations to conditions that would 
normally be observed by a pilot. Values for the collection efficiency 
for a 3-inch cylinder for various drop sizes were taken from reference 6. 
Figure 4 indicates that 90 percent of all measured icing 
conditions caused an icing rate of less than 3 grams per square centimeter 
per hour (1.5 in./hr, with an ice density of O.8). One-half 
of the observations were in icing conditions of less than 1.3 grams 
per square centimeter per hour (0.6 in./hr). The maximum condition 
observed so far has been 5.3 grams per square centimeter per hour, 
which is equivalent to about 2.6 inches per hour. The maximum 
design conditions for layer-type clouds specified in reference 4 give 
a computed icing rate of approximately 4 inches per hour when related 
to a 3-inch-diameter cylinder.

## CONCLUSIONS  
>The following general conclusions are based on the observations 
gathered during two winter of icing flights from the Lewis laboratory:  
>1. In supercooled layer clouds that exist over the Great Lakes area, 
icing intensities are usually light (based upon the U. S. 
Weather Bureau scale of icing intensity in reporting icing conditions 
at mountain stations) but may occasionally approach an icing rate 
of moderate intensity.  
>2. Data collected during the two seasons indicate that the 
specifications of maximum  icing conditions in terms of liquid-water 
content, mean-effective drop diameter, and temperature previously 
proposed for supercooled layer-type clouds appear to be adequate 
for the Great Lakes and surrounding regions.
