#"A Method for Rapid Determination of the Icing Limit of a Body in Terms of the Stream Conditions" [^1]

##Summary
The warmest ambient temperature at which ice can accumulate is calculated.

##Abstract

> The effects of existing frictional heating were analyzed to determine 
the conditions under which ice formations on aircraft surfaces can
be prevented. A method is presented for rapidly determining by means
of charts the combination of-Mach number, altitude, and stream temperature 
which will maintain an ice-free surface in an icing cloud. The
method can be applied to both subsonic and supersonic flow. The charts
presented are for Mach numbers up to 1.8 and pressure altitudes from sea
level to 45,000 feet.
    
##Discussion

Some of the previous publications reviewed calculate the conditions as which all 
impinging water will freeze, 
this publication calculates the conditions at which none of it will freeze.
