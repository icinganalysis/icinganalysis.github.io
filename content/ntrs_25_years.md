Dust off your Netscape Navigator browser [^1] and research like it's 1999!  

Or, experience the archived version for December, 1998, at [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/19981212015823/http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/).  

## Notes  

[^1]: Hmm, it appears that [Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) has not been supported since 2008. 
Oh well, just use [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) then.
