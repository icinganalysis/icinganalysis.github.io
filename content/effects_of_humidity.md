>"This frost icing is believed to
result from a combination of super saturation in the tunnel 
and turbulent deposit of small drops 
caused by the presence of rough ice formations on the ram-inlet lips" NACA-RM-E53E07

>"The air was saturated
at all temperatures prior to sprays and the velocity was constant;
therefore, the liquid-water content should also have been approximately
constant." NACA-RM-E50I08
