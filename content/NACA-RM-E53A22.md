## Abstract  

> The heat requirements for the icing protection of two radome configurations 
have been studied. over a range of design icing conditions.
Both the protection limits of a typical thermal protection system and
the relative effects of the various icing variables have been determined.
For full evaporation of all impinging water, an effective heat density
of 14 watts per square inch was required. When a combination of the
full evaporation and running-wet surface systems was employed, a heat
requirement of 5 watts per square inch provided protection at severe
icing and operating conditions.  

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
>Radar is becoming of increasing importance in the design and
operation of aircraft. Successful operation of these aircraft demands
that the performance of the radar system including the radome be unimpaired 
by environmental factors including icing conditions. Recent
experimental investigations have shown that radomes mounted in the nose
of an aircraft are very susceptible to icing and that this radome icing
has serious effects on the radar operation resulting from a marked
decrease in the transmission efficiency and a deflection of the radar
beam. Protection of the radome against icing, therefore, is required.
This protection can be achieved, in several ways, including: applying
a temperature-depressant material to the radome surface, or heating the
radome surface sufficiently to prevent the formation of ice. This report
will consider only the thermal protection method.  
> 
>The determination of the heating requirements and the performance
of a thermal icing protection system requires many complex calculations.
Much of the basic information required. for such a calculation, particularly 
for a body such as a radome operating at high speeds, is not always
readily available nor in a form directly applicable for engineering
design purposes. For these reasons, the performance of a radome thermal
icing protection system has been studied at assumed operational and icing
conditions. The objectives of this study, which was conducted at the
NACA Lewis laboratory, were to determine the protection requirements
for a typical thermal icing protection system and to study the relative
effects of the various icing variables on these protection requirements.  

>ANALYSIS  
> 
>This investigation is divided into two parts: (1) a study of protection 
requirements for complete evaporation of all the water impinging
upon the radome, resulting in a dry surface, and (2) a study of protection 
requirements for the case of a running-wet condition, that is, only
sufficient heat is supplied, to maintain the coldest point on the surface
of the radome at 32Â° F and thus prevent the formation of ice on the
radome. In this latter method, the excess water not evaporated from
the radome surface will flow aft and freeze on the unheated. portions of
the aircraft.

size and shape, airspeed, temperature, pressure, and water droplet size.
The values of collection efficiency used in this analysis were obtained
from the data of reference 3 and unpublished experimental data.

Reference 3 has impingement data for a sphere, but not a radome. 
Perhaps a sphere with the leading edge radius of curvature was used as an estimate. 

Unfortunately, the "unpublished experimental data" is not further detailed. 

>The latent heat of vaporization L was taken as 1060 Btu per
pound, K as 1.0, V1 as 0.87*V0, and r as 0.85. Assuming values
of to and corresponding values of Pa and Em for a given condition
of airspeed and effective heat input q, equations (1), (4), and (5)
were solved simultaneously by trial and error for the limiting values of
liquid-water content. This value of liquid-water content represents
the maximum value for the assumed conditions for which all the impinging
water will be evaporated within the heated surface area of the radome.
An airspeed of 600 miles per hour was assumed throughout the study
together with an effective heat density of 2100 Btu per hour per square
foot, equal to 4 watts per square inch. This heat density was considered 
to be uniform over the surface area of the radome.  

>Icing Conditions  
> 
>The degree of protection afforded a vulnerable aircraft component
by a thermal icing protection system is dependent upon the icing conditions 
that will be encountered as well as upon the availability of heat
and the system efficiency. Thus, in the design and in the appraisal of
a protection system, the expected. icing conditions must be studied and
established in order to obtain answers that are of reasonable engineering 
validity. The important variables that must be considered in
defining an icing condition are the cloud liquid-water content, the
water droplet size and size distribution, the air temperature and pressure, 
and the extent and frequency of occurrence of a particular type
of cloud. Extensive studies of these factors and their combinations
have been made by the NACA. Statistical studies of icing conditions
and methods of determining the proper combination of the important icing
variables have been reported in references 4 and 5.

>In the selection of the variables defining an icing condition, the
collection efficiency of the body must also be considered since it is
as important as the cloud water content and cloud extent in determining
the severity of a particular icing condition. The collection efficiency
of the radomes considered in this analysis was used (as indicated in
ref. 4) to determine the particular combination of values of liquid-water 
content and droplet size for a particular frequency of occurrence
that resulted in the maximum rate of impingement.  
> 
>Since the heat requirements for a thermal protection system are
dependent on the air temperature, it was decided to employ a 
temperature-altitude relation representative of icing conditions. Reference 4 
presents the observed variation of air temperature and pressure altitude
in icing conditions. Considerable variation in air temperature for a
given altitude is shown by these data; and for this reason and also to
obtain a more realistic basis for appraisal of the protection system,
the temperature-altitude curves shown in figure 1 were selected.

conditions.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E53A22%2FFigure%201.png)  

>One
curve represents the average of the data of reference 4, while the
second curve is a fairing through the points of lowest temperature
reported in reference 4. The NACA standard atmosphere is also given
in figure 1 for comparative purposes. From these temperature-altitude
relations and from an assumed exceedence probability of 1 in 1000, the
particular combinations of liquid-water content and droplet size which
gave maximum rate of impingement were chosen from the curves of reference 5.  
> 
>The liquid-water content and droplet size corresponding to
cumulus clouds were taken for the low-temperature condition as representing 
extremely severe icing conditions, while layer cloud values
were taken for the average temperature conditions as being typical of
average icing conditions, especially with respect to extent of the condition 
and as the limit for which the full evaporation system would.
provide protection. The resultant curves of liquid-water content and
droplet size against air temperature are shown in figure 2. The droplet 
size distribution assumed in the analysis is shown in figure 3.

The basis of the assumptions for Figure 3 are not explained. 
However, the distribution is vaguely like a Langmuir D or E distribution.  

>Miscellaneous Assumptions  
> 
>In addition to the icing conditions, several other factors were
assumed for the purposes of the analysis. Two radome configurations
were investigated, half-sections of which are shown in figure 4,
together with the pertinent dimensions. Both radomes, which were
assumed to be nose installations, were portions of ellipsoidal bodies
of revolution. It was assumed that protection was required to the rear
of the radomes.

unpublished experimental data obtained from tests of similar bodies
in the icing research tunnel.

>The assumed icing conditions
taken from figure 2 are designated as the icing limit, and it is assumed
that no protection is necessary for conditions to the left of this curve.
For the case in which no heat is applied ter the radome, an ice-free
running-wet surface for certain conditions results from the kinetic temperature 
rise. This condition is obtained for all temperatures above
approximately 2Â° F (equivalent to approximately 8000 ft). With the
assumed heat density of 41 watts per square inch, the limit for the
ice-free running-wet condition becomes approximately -18Â° F. For all air
temperatures to the right of this curve and for the values of
liquid-water content shown, the surface temperature will be equal to
or greater than 32Â° F with varying percentages of the impinging water
being evaporated. As indicated by both the heated and unheated running-wet 
curves, the requirement for this condition is almost independent of
variations in liquid-water content and is almost entirely dependent upon
the air temperature.
> 
>For the case of full evaporation, in which the radome surface is
maintained dry, the limiting liquid-water content varies from 
approximately 0.45 gram per cubic meter at -30Â° F to 0.5 gram per cubic meter
at 20Â° F. The surface will be kept dry for all liquid-water and 
air-temperature conditions below the full evaporation curve. For the case
of full evaporation, the calculated average surface temperature varied,
from approximately 63Â° to 76Â° F. In contrast to the case of the running-wet 
condition, the requirement for full evaporation is almost independent
of variations in air temperature.  
> 
>The area below the icing-condition-limit curve that is not protected
either by full evaporation or the running-wet condition is seen to be
rather small. In this region, ice resulting from both direct water
impingement and from runback and refreezing on the radome surface will
be obtained.  
> 
>In order to obtain an estimate of the heat density required for
protection over the full range of expected icing conditions, calculations
were made of the variation of the heat requirement with water content
and with air temperature for the full evaporation and running-wet systems, 
respectively, at specific values of altitude, droplet size, temperature, 
and liquid-water content. These results are presented in
figures 6 and 7 for the A-radome. The effect of kinetic heating is
indicated in figure 6 by the evaporation of water up to 0.09 gram per
cubic meter without the application of heat. The heat requirement for
full evaporation is seen to vary almost linearly with liquid-water content; 
the heat requirement for a running-wet surface also approaches
a linear relation with air temperature. From an extrapolation of the
relations of figure 6, it is determined that protection by means of full
evaporation alone over the full range of icing conditions would require
an effective heat density of approximately 14 watts per square inch.
Full protection by a combination of the evaporation and running-wet
surface systems over the entire range of expected icing conditions could.
be achieved, with an effective heat density of approximately 5 watts per
square inch.

Only results for the A-Radome are discussed herein.  

## Conclusions  

>CONCLUDING REMARKS  
> 
>In the analysis presented herein it was necessary to make several
assumptions. It is believed, that most of these assumptions, including
the icing conditions, are of reasonable validity. The most important
assumptions that might be questioned are the impingement efficiency and
the assumption of an average or uniform effective heat density. The
impingement efficiencies used in the analysis are based upon the values
for spheres given in reference 3 and upon experimental results for similar 
radomes obtained at lower airspeeds. For the case of the running-wet surface, 
the value of the assumed local impingement efficiency is
relatively unimportant since, as shown by the results of the analysis,
the heat requirement is almost independent of the amount of water caught.
For the case of full evaporation the heat requirement, as indicated by
the results of figure 6, is directly dependent on the amount of water
caught. The total collection efficiencies are regarded as accurate
within at least Â±10 percent. Based upon the results of figure 6, the
heat requirements in the range of interest have approximately the same
degree of accuracy.  
> 
>A more important limitation of the results for the case of full
evaporation is the fact that a uniform heat density over the radome
surface was assumed and the calculations were made on an average basis
rather than by computing the system performance on a point-to-point
basis from the radome nose aft. The attainment of both a uniform heat
density and surface temperature is impossible and, practically, even
the attainment of uniform heat density would be extremely difficult.
It is believed, however, that the use of average values in the calculation 
of the performance of the protection system is valid for the
purposes of this analysis as indicating within the limits of engineering
accuracy the order of magnitude of the limits of performance of the
protection system and the variation of these limits with the important
icing variables.  
> 
>The results of the analysis have indicated that Icing protection
of a radome by a thermal protection system can be achieved with reasonable 
values of heat density even at extreme combinations of operating
and icing conditions. For full evaporation of all impinging water, an
effective heat density of 14 watts per square inch is required. By
employing a running-wet surface system over part of the temperature
range and full evaporation over the remainder, protection over the full
range of icing conditions can be achieved with an effective heat density
of 5 watts per square inch. The heat requirement for full evaporation
is dependent primarily upon the rate of water catch or, in terms of the
icing condition, the cloud liquid-water content. For the running-wet
surface condition, the heat requirement is primarily a function of the
ambient air temperature. The use of the running-wet surface system will
be dependent not only on the effects of a water film on radar operation
but also on the tolerance of the aircraft for runback ice formations aft
of the radome.  

The "serious effects" mentioned in the introduction of radome ice on the performance of radar 
depend on the specific radar being used and the performance requirements. 
Many commercial airplanes with weather radar do not have radome ice protection.
