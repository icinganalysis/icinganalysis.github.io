##Discussion  

The online version of NACA-TN-1598 has many good quality images, 
several are included here. 

Like [NACA-TN-313]({filename}NACA-TN-313.md) I found much of my own icing flight test experience was reflected in NACA-TN-1598,
published 70+ years ago. 
I saw similar ice shapes on another airplane, decades later. 

For brevity, I will omit the discussion about propeller icing. 

The aircraft used for the icing flight tests: 
![Figure 1](images/naca-tn-1598/Figure1.png)  
This may merit a thread all of its own, 
you can see more about the ice protection equipment of the XB-25E "Flamin' Maimie" at [https://www.nasa.gov/specials/NACA/#c19](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/NACA/#c19).
I would fly in icing conditions in this airplane, unlike the VE-7 from [NACA-TN-313]({filename}NACA-TN-313.md). 

Figure 2 shows a view of the multicylinder instrument, and the rotating disk:
![Figure 2](images/naca-tn-1598/Figure2.png)  
(The line crossing the multicylinder is a wire antenna, not an image flaw.)

An excellent illustration of the 4 inch ice accumulation:
![Figure 7](images/naca-tn-1598/Figure7.png)  

And more ice:

The forward radome, appears to have not retained all of the ice on landing:
