## Abstract  

> Measurements of propeller efficiency loss due to ice formation are
supplemented by an analysis to establish the magnitude of efficiency
losses to be anticipated during flight in icing conditions. The measurements 
were made during flight in natural icing conditions; whereas the
analysis consisted of an investIgation of changes in blade-section 
aerodynamic characteristics caused by ice formation and the resulting 
propeller efficiency changes. Agreement in the order of magnitude of 
efficiency losses tobe expected is obtained between measured and analytical
results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can
be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which
will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent.
Reported. losses larger than 15 or 20 percent, based on reductions in
airplane performance, probably are due to ice accretions on other parts
of the airplane.  
> 
>Blade-element theory is used in the analytical treatment, and calculations 
are made to show the degree to which the aerodynamic characteristics of 
a blade section must be altered to produce various propeller
efficiency losses. The effects of ice accretions on airfoil-section
characteristics at subcritical speeds and their influence on drag-divergence 
Mach number are examined, and the attendant maximum efficiency
losses are computed. The effect of kinetic heating on the radial extent
of ice formation is considered, and its influence on required length of
blade heating shoes is discussed. It is demonstrated how the efficiency
loss resulting from an icing encounter is influenced by the decisions of
the pilot in adjusting the engine and propeller controls.  

## Discussion  

This publication is extensive (80 pages), 
so only selected sections to illustrate some findings 
are included here.  

>INTRODUCTION
> 
>It has long been recognized that one of the hazards of flight in.
icing conditions is the formation of ice on propellers. The presence
of ice on propeller blades causes a decrease in the operating efficiency
of the propeller and. a corresponding decrease in the-airplane performance.
There has been much disagreement as to the actual magnitude of efficiency
losses experienced in icing conditions. Measurements have been made of
propeller efficiency losses with simulated ice formations (references 1
and 2) and. in natural icing conditions (reference 3). The measured losses
were low when compared with those generally expected; however, reports
of very large apparent losses, deduced from decrease in airplane performance, 
persisted. A review of the available data (references 1, 2, and 3)
indicated, that further efficiency-loss measurements supplemented by an
analysis of the problem would be required. before conclusive statements
could be made regarding the order of magnitude of losses to 1e anticipated
in icing conditions. The objectives of the present investigation, therefore, 
were to provide additional measurements of propeller efficiency loss
resulting from ice formation, and to analyze the problem of efficiency
loss in an attempt to provide a means for applying, generally, the existing 
data. Thus, additional data to determine efficiency loss were obtained
in flight under natural icing conditions as part of a comprehensive 
investigation of aircraft icing by the NACA. Another phase of the program
(reported in reference 4) was the investigation of the meteorological factors 
conducive to icing, therefore providing quantitative data on the
severity of the icing conditions under which propeller-performance 
measurements were made.

>The research was conducted by the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory. Data
were obtained over most of the United States during the winters of 1946—47
and 1947-48. Measurements made during the winter of 19146-47 are included
in reference 3. The results of the 194-48 winter season are presented in
this report.

>DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT
> 
>The flight tests were conducted with the twin-engine airplane shown in
figure 1. Modifications had been made to provide thermal ice-prevention
equipment for the wings, tail, and windshield. A description of the thermal 
system is given in reference 5. The right engine and propeller were
utilized for the purposes of the research, and standard commercial 
electrically heated blade shoes were installed on the left propeller for ice
protection.

>The test propeller consisted. of four blades composed of double-camber
Clark Y sections. The diameter was 13.5 feet. Characteristics of the
blade design as supplied by the manufacturer are given in figure 2. The
symbols used in this figure and throughout the report are listed and
defined in Appendix A. Specially built blade heating shoes, constructed
at the Ames Laboratory, were installed. for propeller heating tests, which
were made in conjunction with the performance tests. The shoes consisted
of several wrappings of cloth tape in which the heater elements were
embedded. Two-inch-wide strips of metal were cemented over the wrappings
along, the leading edges of the blades in order to protect the shoes from
abrasion. An enlarged spinner, built for the purpose of housing instrumentation 
related to the heating studies, was mounted on the test propeller.
Figure 3 shows the test propeller complete with heating shoes and spinner.
White marking lines were painted on the blades for ease in noting ice
locations.

>A thrustmeter and a torquemeter were installed in the right engine
for measuring thrust and torque absorbed by the test propeller. Both the
thrustmeter and the torquemeter utilized pistons which were hydraulically
restrained so that the pressure required to maintain the pistons in a
floating condition gave a measure of thrust or torque being absorbed by
the propeller.  

>Curves of efficiency as a function of advance ratio for the propeller
with ice accumulations are compared with efficiency curves for the clean
propeller in figures 10 to 16. These curves were drawn employing values
of thrust and power coefficients from table III and from the curves of
figure 9 by using the formula  
```text
η = CT / CP J

where
η    propeller efficiency
CT   thrust coefficient
CP   power coefficient
J    advance ratio
```

>Figure 10 presents the variation of efficiency loss for one type of
formation at two blade angles, and figure 11 shows the efficiency-loss.
variation for another class of formation at approximately the same blade
angles. A comparison of efficiency losses for two classes of formation
for the same blade angle is given in figure 12, while figure 13 compares
losses for five formations at a higher blade angle, and figure 14 compares 
losses for two formations at a still higher blade angle. Figure 15
gives the efficiency loss for a low-temperature condition in which the ice
extended, nearly to the blade tips. Figure 16 presents a plot of efficiency 
data for formations which accumulated during two encounters with
propeller-blade heating. Heat was applied cyclically to the forward
10 percent of the blade chord and., as was mentioned previously, primary
ice formations, together with small amounts of runback, gathered back of
the heated regions.

>Photographs of the clean propeller blades with heating shoes
Installed are shown in figure 17. These show the leading-edge metallic
abrasion strips installed on the blades and the white-line markings
painted on the shoes to provide a means for identifying the particular
blade photographed and. the extent of ice formations. It will be noted.
that, In some of the pictures of the thrust face of the blades, the
leading-edge abrasion strips unfortunately give the appearance of ice
formations and, therefore, should not be confused with the actual formations. 
Pictures of the ice accretions for which efficiency data were
obtained are presented in figures 18 to 31.

>Influence of Operating Conditions on Propeller Efficiency Losses in Icing Conditions  
> 
>When a propeller accumulates ice, the resulting changes in propeller
performance are reflected in corresponding changes in airplane performance. 
Depending on how the pilot reacts to the changes, various operating
conditions can be established which may have an increased detrimental
effect on the propeller performance.  

>Thus it appears that in operation of unprotected or inadequately
protected propellers in icing conditions, periodic attempts should be
made to throwoff the accretions by increasing propeller speed. If the
ice cannot be removed, it is desirable to operate at or near the peak of
the efficiency-envelope curve for the iced. propeller. This peak is
probably located at about the same value of advance ratio as the peak
for clean blades.

## Conclusions  

> As the result of measurements of propeller performance loss due to
ice formation, made during flight in natural icing conditions and 
supplemented by an analysis of the factors contributing to performance loss
(in which all values apply for propeller advance ratios up to about 2),
the following conclusions are reached:  
>1. During the vast majority of icing encounters with unprotected
propellers on present-day transports, propeller efficiency losses can be
expected to be less than 10 percent.  
>2. The maximum loss to be anticipated for propellers free of adverse
compressibility effects is about 15 percent; hereas, for propellers 
operating above the critical speed, the maximum loss to be expected is about
20 percent.
>3. Reported propeller efficiency losses larger than about 15 or
20 percent, based on reductions in airplane performance, probably are
actually due to icing of other components.
>4. The magnitude of efficiency loss resulting from an icing encounter
can be influenced, by the decisions of the pilot in adjusting the engine
and propeller controls.
