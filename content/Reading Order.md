This is the main focus of the blog, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
publications on aircraft icing, 1915 to 1958.  

There are 132 publications in [The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications
]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md).
