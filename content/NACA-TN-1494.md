## Abstract  

> SUMMARY  
> 
> A detailed method is presented for determining the temperature
and flow of heated gas necessary for ice prevention of hollow propeller 
> blades in flight and icing conditions; The propeller blade
is analytically divided into a number of short radial segments,
which are successively treated as separate heat exchangers. Expressions 
for the total external and internal heat transfer are combined 
to determine the surface temperatures of each segment. The
thermodynamic steady-flow equation is given for the internal gas-flow 
process and expressions are obtained for the radial variations
of gas temperature and pressure within the blade. For a given
initial gas temperature in the blade shank cavity, the minimum gas
flow is determined, which will provide surface temperatures of at
least 32° F everywhere on the heated portion of the blade.
An expression for the required heat-source-input to the gas
is included and a formula is given for calculating the required
blade-tip nozzle area.
> 
> A discussion is included of the indicated benefits to be
derived from certain alterations of the blade internal flow
passage.  

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
> Thermal prevention of the formation of ice on aircraft propellers 
has been previously investigated by means of electrical
and hot-gas heating, The heat requirements associated with the
ue of external, electrically heated rubber blade shoes are
analyzed in reference 1. Flight investigations of thermal systems 
using hot gas within hollow propeller blades have been
reported in reference 2, and by Palmatier and Brigham of the
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.  
> 
> The present analysis was made at the NACA Cleveland laboratory 
to provide a method for predicting the hot-gas flow and the
Initial gas temperature required for satisfactory ice prevention
on hollow propeller blades. This method involves a system of
progressive approximations considering successive radially disposed 
blade segments as separate heat exchangers. Account is
taken of the heat required to raise the temperature of the intercepted 
free water to the-blade-surface temperature, the cooling
effect of the evaporation of water, and the kinetic heating of the
external-air boundary layer. The physical changes of the hot gas
in flowing through the hollow blade are determined, in order to
find the required tip nozzle area. The detailed analysis is
applied to a typical propeller blade; for flight at two assumed
operating conditions at the same icing conditions to illustrate
the step-by-step procedure and to demonstrate typical results.
A method of modifying the blade internal passage is suggested
whereby the heating requirements may be reduced. for a given
application of the hot-gas method of preventing ice on typical
hollow propellers.
 
>METHOD FOR DETERMINING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS  
> 
> Description of Solution  
> 
> The determination of the required gas-flow rates for a hot-gas 
type of anti-icing system on given aircraft propeller
involves a tedious series of calculations.  The information
available at the present time is insufficient to determine 
quickly the maximum requirements for a given propeller operating
through a range of flight and icing conditions. Individual calculations 
must be made for a complete series of selected, critical
flight and icing conditions. The blade-tip nozzle area and the
heat-source capacity are then calculated for the maximum requirements so determined.  
> 
> The degree of approximation obtained through the use of the
subsequent analysis will remain uncertain until more complete and
reliable experimental data are available on propeller-blade
external and internal heat-transfer coefficients, kinetic heating
of wet air, heat losses due to evaporation of water, the extent
of heat conduction in the blade metal, and the determination 
of minimum standards for ice prevention.  
> 
> A schematic diagram of the heated-gas flow through a typical
hollow propeller blade is illustrated in figure 1. The gas is
first heated by a suitable heat source, enters a stationary
transfer manifold, and then passes through a collector ring and 
cuffs fastened to the propeller hub and into the blade shanks.
The hot gas then flows radially outward through the hollow blades,
which may have internal radial partitions (fig. 1), to discharge 
nozzles in the blade tips.

> The required gas flow, which is defined as the rate that will
maintain the heated portion of a blade surface at temperature at
or above 32° F, must be computed by trial. For conventional
propeller-blade designs, the point of lowest calculated surface
temperature will usually be at the stagnation point of a radial
station near the hub. Under severe icing conditions, there is no
great variation of calculated leading-edge surface temperature
with propeller radius at the inboard, stations, although heat conducted 
radially outward from the blade hub will actually raise the
surface temperatures at the inner radii. If the effect of this
heat conduction from the blade shank does not extend too far along
the blade at the leading edge, the use of the stagnation-point
surface temperature at the innermost blade segment as the critical
point for determining the required and
gas flow will permit more rapid
seldom will a complete
progression with the trial values
analysis of all segments be necessary.

>Steps in Solution

> For each set of flight and icing conditions the following
step-by-step method of solution is suggested.

> NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  
> 
> Flight and Icing Conditions  
> 
> The procedure for determining the design requirements for a
gas-heated propeller has been applied to a theoretical hollow steel
propeller having blades with central radial ribs, as shown in
figure 1. The propeller-blade-form characteristics are given in
figure 4 and other pertinent data in table I. An assumption has
been made that heated air enters the blade shanks from a collector
ring through suitable orifices and passes radially outward through
only the leading-edge cavity in the blades, as illustrated in
figure 1. The blade was arbitrarily divided for convenience into
four radial segments each 1 foot long starting at the 18-inch
station. The radial stations for which the surface-temperature
calculations were made were therefore at 24, 36, 48, and 60 inches.
(See fig. 4.)

>For more accurate results calculations nearer the
hub may be necessary. A greater number of shorter radial segments 
may also be needed in regions where either the blade airfoil section 
or the internal flow area-changes rapidly with radius.
For purposes of comparison, the calculations have been made 
for the two following operating conditions through the same icing
condition:

![Results.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1494%2FResults.png)  

> DISCUSSION  
> 
> Thin-Skin Approximation  
> 
> The largest source of error In this analysis is thought to be
the thin-skin approximation used in the solution of external surface 
temperatures. This approximation makes use of two related
assumptions. First, the value of Hg depends on the temperature
differential (tg,d - ts), in which the temperature gradient
through the blade metal assumed to be zero. This gradient and
the error involved is usually small, except at the leading-edge
region, for any propeller blade made of steel or metal with equal
or higher thermal conductivity. Second, the heat balance employed
in equation (22) is based on the assumption that the total heat
transfer from the internal gas to the external air can be considered 
to be distributed uniformly and to pass only normally
through suitable internal and external heat-transfer areas; that
is, the blade metal is assumed to be infinitely thin and surface-wise 
heat conduction is neglected. The ratio of the teo heat-transfer areas 
is then used to determine the ratio of the local
internal and external heat-transfer rates. The error involved in
this assumption is thought-to be large inasmuch as the thermal
conductivity of the blade metal is usually very high compared
with the conductivity through the gas and air surface films. Surface-wise 
heat conduction within the blade metal is certain to
reduce the temperature gradients indicated, by the variations of
surface-film heat-transfer coefficients and changes in metal
thickness.
> 
> The two foregoing errors can be eliminated from the analysis
of the blade segments are studied using the "relaxation" method
developed in reference 15. No attempt has been made to use this
method because of the prodigious amount of time and effort involved.
The method and a sample of the results to be expected from it are
given in appendix E.

> Suggested Technique for Reducing Heat Flows  
> 
> A method of reducing the required heat flow in a typical hollow 
propeller blade is suggested in which the internal flow passage
is altered to attain a more economical distribution of heat transfer.  
> 
> In summarizing these modifications, if the area of the internal 
flow passage is reduced and the internal heat-transfer area is
increased, the same total heat transfer to the external surface
can be maintained while the internal-gas flow is greatly reduced.
A reduction of the flow lowers the internal velocity and the friction 
loss and thus raises the available internal pressure. When
the flow is reduced, more heat is removed per pound of gas flow
and, consequently, the gas temperature falls more rapidly and
reduces the heat loss at the tip nozzle. Care should be taken
with the internal heat-transfer area that some segments do not
abstract such heat as to starve subsequent segments.
> 
> In addition to the foregoing reduction of heat flow, a better
distribution of chordwise surface heat transfer can be accomplished
by making the greatest increase of Internal heat-transfer area at
the leading edge by the use of fins similar to those shown in
figure 12. An accurate determination of the magnitude of the heat
transfer resulting from these modifications requires that the
whole problem be approached along the lines of the relaxation
method as outlined in appendix E. All the Indications shown lead
to the belief that a hollow propeller blade can be designed with
modifications similar to those illustrated, which will efficiently
provide ice protection with a heat flow of feasible proportions.

## Conclusions  

>COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
> 
> The method presented for estimating heat requirements for ice
prevention on gas-heated hollow, propeller blades provides integrated 
means for determining the design requirements for ice prevention on 
gas-heated hollow propeller blades operating in any
selected condition. Several of the suggested simplifications and
other short methods can be used where conditions do not require a
rigorous treatment. Solutions by trial are occasionally required,
which are admittedly inconvenient, but become fairly rapid with
increased familiarity.
> 
> Substantiation of several formulas, upon which this method
is based, by experimental measurements in actual icing conditions
is recommended. A relaxation analysis of the whole  propeller
blade should be made to determine the effect of leading-edge
internal ribs and the exact heat transfer normally, radially, and
chordwise through the blade metal.
