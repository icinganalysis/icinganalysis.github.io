### _"Considerable time [was devoted] to means for controlling the amount of water sprayed into the air stream, the size of water particles, and the temperatures of the air and water" [^1]_  

## Summary  
Calibration methods evolved during the NACA-era

## Key Points  
1. Early tests had informal calibrations, partly due to a limited understanding of the natural icing environment.  
2. Rotating multicylinders were the most used means of calibration.  
3. Water spray nozzles were improved circa 1949.  
4. The understanding of the natural icing environment had also advanced by 1949.  

## Discussion  

As implied from the quote above from the year 1929, 
the calibration of an icing wind tunnel is often not just measuring what the facility produces, 
but also altering and improving the facility to achieve target values for water drop size and 
liquid water content, 
and producing a water drop spray that is uniform "enough". 

### Early calibrations  

Two early icing wind tunnel tests had informal calibrations (compared to today's standards [^2]).

#### [NACA-TN-339]({filename}NACA-TN-339.md), 1930 (Langley Refrigerated Wind Tunnel) [^3]: 

>Certain preliminary tests were made in the wind tunnel to
determine the best form of water spray necessary to produce ice
of smooth appearance and which would be similar in structure
and form to that observed in flight (Reference 12), in order to
make a study of possible preventives.
It was found that the
character of the formations obtained depended to a great degree
on the quantity of water admitted to the tunnel per unit of time.
A spray which consisted of large drops was found to use excessive
quantities of water which could not be properly regulated without 
giving very poor dispersion in the jet, and which gave formations 
of ice on the model of a very different shape from any
obtained in flight.
A spray, which consisted of very small
drops, was found to be quite satisfactory and was used in all
the following tests, as it could be easily controlled to give
even dispersion across the air stream at any desired rate of
water output.

#### NACA-TN-712, 1939 (Langley 7-foot by 10-foot wind tunnel) [^4]: 
  
>Natural precipitations were simulated by admitting
water to the air stream through a spray nozzle.
The tunnel test section with the model and the spray are diagrammatically shown in figure 1.

[There will be a discussion of this figure when we get to "Large Drop Icing" 
in the [Icing Wind Tunnel Test thread]({filename}Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread.md)]

>The range of control over the formation of ice was
such that a simulation of all typical ice formations
found in flight could be produced.

### Calibrations in the IRT

Calibrations methods in the NACA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) 
evolved over time. 

#### Drop size calibration methods:  

1946 NACA-TN-1134 pool of castor oil  
1947 [NACA-TN-1246]({filename}NACA-TN-1246.md) rotating multicylinders  
1948 NACA-RM-E8A27 rotating multicylinder "by volume maximum"  
(new nozzles design circa 1949, per "We Freeze to Please")  
1950 [NACA-RM-E50I08]({filename}NACA-RM-E50I08.md) rotating multicylinder MVD  
1951 [NACA-RM-E51B12]({filename}NACA-RM-E51B12.md) "in the range of natural icing conditions"  
1951 NACA-TN-2480 (apparently multicylinder) "the mean-effective droplet diameter was varied from about 8 to 12 microns by adjusting the nozzle-air pressure" \*  
1952 NACA-TN-2615 absorbent cylinders (special purpose in transonic tunnel)  
1953 [NACA-TN-2962]({filename}NACA-TN-2962.md) "The icing conditions were determined from a previous calibration of the tunnel and periodically checked with a pressure-type icing-rate meter"   
1955 NACA-RM-E54I03 "the results shown were calculated from unpublished wind-tunnel water-droplet impingement data obtained by means of water droplets carrying dye in solution."  

\* I note this because it implies that they had enough confidence in the control systems and prior calibrations so that 
conditions could be set just by the spray control parameters.

#### LWC calibration methods: 

1946 NACA-TN-1134 free-water sampling rake  
1947 [NACA-TN-1246]({filename}NACA-TN-1246.md) rotating multicylinders  
1948 NACA-TN-1586 rotating cylinder grid  
1952 NACA-TN-2615 absorbent cylinders (special purpose in transonic tunnel)  
1953 NACA-TN-2962 "The icing conditions were determined from a previous calibration of the tunnel and periodically checked with a pressure-type icing-rate meter"   
1955 [NACA-TN-3338]({filename}NACA-TN-3338.md)NACA-TN-3338 cylinders, ribbon, aspirator  
1955 NACA-TN-3564 "Liquid-water content was measured by means of a pressure-type icing-rate meter"  
1956 NACA-TN-3839 Joukowski-aspirator  
1957 NACA-TN-4155 "Liquid-water content was measured by means of a pressure-type icing-rate meter"  
1958 NACA-TN-4268 "The cloud total liquid-water content was obtained by collecting dye from the spray cloud in an aspirating device (a tube that draws in the cloud at free-stream conditions)"

it contains data from a test conducted in 1945.

###Natural icing conditions characterizations  

Calibration may be thought of as understanding the conditions that a facility can achieve. 

Another step is knowing what the flight conditions are that one wants to simulate. 

The understanding of natural icing conditions was also evolving in the NACA-era. 
This topic merits a thread of its own, but for now I will very briefly summarize. 

In 1947 there was some understanding of MVD and LWC targets. 
This figure is from a presentation by William Lewis [^5]. 

![Figure 3 from William Lewis presentation. Liquid-water content, W, and average 
drop diameter in icing clouds.](images/william_lewis_1947/Figure 3.png)  

This had advanced by 1949 to something close to our current understanding. 
As mentioned in the [Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread]({filename}Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread.md), 
the current icing regulations environment definition was largely determined by a few NACA publications, 
NACA-TN-1855 [^6] being one of them. 
Readers may recognize the values of "II-M Intermittent Maximum"
and "III-M Continuous Maximum" in Table I below 
as being part of the current regulations. 

![Table I of NACA-TN-1855. Recommended values of meteorological factors for 
consideration in the design of aircraft ice-prevention equipment.](images/naca-tn-1855/Table 1.png)  

It was fortunate that by 1949 the IRT spray system was able to 
produce sprays similar to at least a portion of these values. 

So, by 1951, NACA-RM-E51B12 could declare that the test conditions were "in the range of natural icing conditions".
