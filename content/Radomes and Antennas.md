### _"The current use of improved airplane ice-prevention equipment has extended operations in icing conditions and thus accentuated the need for protecting aircraft antennas against structural failures resulting from ice accretions"_

These reviews are for studies of the effect of ice on radomes and antennas.

Many current aircraft do not have ice protection for radomes and antennas. 
The effects of ice can generally be tolerated. 
However, a manufacturer has to prove the robustness through test and analysis. 
The shedding of ice off of these structures also need to be considered.
