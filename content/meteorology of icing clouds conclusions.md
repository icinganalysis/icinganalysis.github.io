## Summary  
The most enduring legacy of the NACA publications on icing meteorology is their 
direct influence on the current icing regulations. 

## Key Points  
1. NACA publications contributed heavily to the creation of the Appendix C icing regulation.  
2. The key flight tests and publications were complete by 1952.  
3. Some engineering judgement went into creating the icing regulation.  
4. There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949.  
5. The data from 1949 compares well to more recent flight test measurements.  

## Discussion  

The most enduring legacy of the NACA publications on icing meteorology is their 
direct influence on the current icing regulations. 

### Icing Regulations and NACA publications  

As we saw in the [Conclusions Meteorological Instruments Thread]({filename}conclusions_of_the_instruments_thread.md),
only a limited number of NACA publications went directly into determining the 
current Appendix C icing requirements [^1].  

![Figure 3-1 Derivation of FAR Icing Standards](/images/Derivation of FAR standards.png) 
[^2]  

[As we saw in [Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread]({filename}cylinder_thread_wrap_up.md), 
it is not entirely clear where this figure originally came from.]  

Thus, by the time [NACA-TN-2738]({filename}NACA-TN-2738.md) was published in 1952, 
all pertinent icing data had been obtained. 

Also note that perhaps the most import part, [NACA-TN-1855]({filename}NACA-TN-1855.md), 
was complete by 1949. 

There were later icing tests and publications 
(see particularly those by Porter Perkins, 
mentioned in [Meteorology of Icing Clouds]({filename}Meteorology.md)). 
However, they did not appear to have directly influenced the icing regulations. 

The process of reaching the current icing regulations in the figure above might appear 
straight-forward, but engineering judgement was applied at several steps along the way. 

### Some comments on the regulations  

Jeck [^3] discusses the Appendix C drop size boundaries:  

>Origins of the "Icing Envelopes" in FAR-25, Appendix C  
> 
>Information printed on figures 1 and 4 of FAR-25, Appendix C states that
NACA report TN-1855 (Jones and Lewis, 1949) is the source of data for these
envelopes. Within TN-1855 the reader is referred to two earlier reports,
TN-1393 (Lewis, 1947) and TN-1424 (Lewis et al., 1947) for the actual data on
which the "continuous maximum" envelopes are based. Both TN-1393 and TN-1424
show numerous observations of MVDs in the range 7 to 15 μm. In fact, figure 6
of TN-1424 contains a probability curve which shows that 50% of the observed
MVDs are smaller than 13 micrometer! None of these references contain any obvious
statements that 15 micrometer was viewed as the minimum MVD worth consideration.  
> 
>However, such conclusions may have arisen implicitly from the discourse in
TN-1393 on the subject of icing forecast problems. On page 16 of that report,
it is proposed that a fixed MVD of 14 μm be assumed for layer clouds in order
to simplify the problem of specifying icing intensities from a knowledge of
cloud type and estimated LWC alone. Also, in a later section (page 22 of
TN-1393) dealing with maximum, continuous LWCs that are likely to occur in
layer clouds, a value of micrometer μm is proposed as a reasonable estimate for MVDs
to be expected concurrently with continuous maximum LWCs of 0.8 g/m3. The
authors then point out that LWCs of 0.5 g/m3 along with MVDs of 25 μm should
be considered as a definite probability in layer clouds too. These
conclusions, coupled with a recollection (page 7 of TN-1393) that severe icing
was observed on the windshield of their C-46 research aircraft with only O.15
g/m^3 of LWC when the MVD was an unusually large 50 μm, apparently led the
author to stress the potential importance of the larger MVDs because of the
greater collection efficiencies associated with them.  

So, not all the choices made in creating the current icing standards have had 
obvious logic. 

Another choice made in creating the icing standards was not including 
freezing rain.  

### Freezing Rain  

For the NACA-TN-1855 class "IV - M Freezing Rain", 
a similar requirement was not incorporated into Appendix C. 
The assumption was apparently that if equipment was protected for other classes of icing, 
then performance might be adequate in freezing rain. 
Status pressure ports were the 
only equipment listed to be considered against freezing rain. 
It was not until 2014 that freezing rain requirements were incorporated into the new 
Appendix O of CFR 14 Part 25 [^4].  

### Change from "Duration" to "Distance" to "Extent" in icing  

The nomenclature changed from "Duration":  

[NACA-TN-1393]({filename}NACA-TN-1393.md)  
![Figure 13:
A graph of log duration minutes vs. log liquid water content g/m^3.
There is an "estimated probable maximum conditions" line 
from 2.8 g/m^3 at 0.7 minutes to 0.38 g/m^3 at 150 minutes.
There are several "observed values" data points below the line.
The airspeed in noted as 150 miles per hour.
](/images/naca-tn-1393/Distance%20effect.png)  

To "Distance":  

[NACA-TN-1904]({filename}NACA-TN-1904.md)  
![Figure 5. Estimated maximum values of average liquid-water content to be expected in 
1000 flights encountering icing, assuming that 5 percent of flights encounter cumulous
clouds.](/images/naca-tn-1904/Figure5.png)  

To "Extent":  

[NACA-TN-2306]({filename}NACA-TN-2306.md)  
![Figure 2. Maximum distance flown during 57 icing flights in relation 
to average measured liquid-water content of supercooled stratiform clouds.
](/images%2FNACA-TN-2306%2FFigure%202.png)  

This change was not explained. 
It is not clear if it was editorial, 
or if some subtle technical difference was implied. 

The Appendix C regulation uses "Extent":  
![Appendix C Figure 3. Liquid Water Content vs. Cloud Horizontal Extent.
](/images%2FAppendix%20C%20Figure%203.png)  

While the nomenclature change may seem to be minor, 
there is an effect on interpretation of the regulation. 
AC 20-73 describes an assumption about an extended duration (45 minute) 
hold in icing. 

> Another use is to estimate ice buildups on unprotected surfaces during a 45-minute hold. For the
45-minute hold discussed in section 8 of this AC, use the LWC from Figure 1 of 14 CFR part 25,
Appendix C at full value. Guidance for the 45-minute hold assumes the conservative case when
the holding pattern remains within 17.4 nm and the LWC is changed from that shown in Figure 1
of 14 CFR part 25, Appendix C.  

The distance traveled during a 45-minute hold for a large transport 
would be much greater than 17.4 nautical miles, 
resulting in a Liquid Water Content Factor of less than 1, 
but the recommendation above is to use a value of 1 anyway.  

### NACA-TN-1855 suggested research tasks  

NACA-TN-1855 suggested six research task to confirm its recommendations. 
These were largely accomplished in NACA-TN-2738.  

However, I could not find if two of the tasks were accomplished:  
```text
3. Obtain flight data to establish drop—size distribution 
   in clouds.  
4. Obtain necessary data in flight through icing clouds for 
   confirmation or modification of the method of assuming adiabatic 
   lifting and no mixing for the calculation of liquid-water content 
   at any level in a cloud.  
```

Several instruments were assessed in the NACA-era 
(see the [Meteorological Instruments Thread]({filename}instruments.md)). 
However, none proved to be a satisfactory alternative to the multicylinder 
method for determining drop-size distributions. 
The best alternative at the time was perhaps some form of water drop imaging,
but it would be decades before that was a practical alternative.  

Appendix C does not mention drop-size distribution. 
Advisory Circular AC 20-73A does include the Langmuir drop size distributions, 
and recommends the use of a D distribution. 

While I did not find a further evaluation of adiabatic lift theory, 
note that the earlier [NACA-TN-1424]({filename}NACA-TN-1424.md) figure 4 (shown further below) 
compares an ideal calculation to one that assumes 2/3 of the water condenses, 
and the 2/3 assumption appears to fit data better. 
Adiabatic lift theory is still used today to estimate maximum cloud liquid water content. 
However, for the simple implementation, the results are often conservatively high 
compared to measured data. 
I suppose that current weather modelling is a much more sophisticated implementation 
of adiabatic lift theory (and a lot of other physics), 
but it is still challenged to calculate accurate LWC values.  

### Tracking changes in the understanding of LWC values  

As an example of how the understanding of liquid water content (LWC) 
changed over the NACA-era, we will take an example point from Appendix C Figure 1
for "Continuous Maximum (Stratiform Clouds)".   

- Temperature = 32F, MVD = 15 micrometer, LWC = 0.8 g/m^3 (17.4 nmi extent)  

(upper left corner of the envelope).

![Appendix C Figure 1. Continuous Maximum (Stratiform Clouds) 
Atmospheric Conditions 
Liquid Water Content vs. Mean Effective Drop Diameter](/images%2FAppCfig1.png)  

We find similar cases in prior publications:  

[NACA-TN-1391]({filename}NACA-TN-1391.md) (1947):  

- LWC = 1.5 g/m^3 (no drop size information) 

![Figure 4. Conditions to be expected at the top of a 3000-foot 
cloud layer. Repesenting the probable maximum intensity of icing in 
noncyclonic stratus clouds.](/images%2FNACA-TN-1391%2FFigure%204.png)  

NACA-TN-1393 (1947):  

- 0.8 g/m^3 (no drop size information)  
![Figure 8. Liquid water content as a function of free air temperature. 
Rotating cyclinder measurements. ](/images%2Fnaca-tn-1393%2FFigure%208.png)  

Reference 6 is [NACA-TN-1391]({filename}NACA-TN-1391.md).  
Reference 14 is Rodert [^6].  

Rodert (1946):  

- 3.0 g/m^3, 30 micrometer (From Table 2 of [^6])  

Rodert notes that:
> The values given in Table 2 are established by a faired line which has
> been drawn on a graphical presentation of weather-bureau data. 
> The faired curve was drawn so as to give values which in all cases
> exceed the data thus far observed and therefore probable. 
> Our knowledge of the weather is obviously inadequate.  

NACA-TN-1424 (1947): 

- Calculation A: 1.0 g/m^3 (no drop size information)  
- Calculation B: 0.8 g/m^3 (no drop size information)  

![Figure 4. Liquid Water Content as related to temperature 
in icing clouds.](/images%2Fnaca-tn-1424%2FFigure%204.png)  

NACA-TN-1855 (1949):  

- Table 1, III-M Continuous Maximum 0.8 g/m^3, 15 micrometer  

In a table sorted by publication order:  

| Source         | Year | LWC, g/m^3 |
|----------------|------|------------|
| Rodert         | 1946 | 3.0        |
| NACA-TN-1391   | 1947 | 1.5        |
| NACA-TN-1393   | 1947 | 0.8        |
| NACA-TN-1424 A | 1947 | 1.0        |
| NACA-TN-1424 B | 1947 | 0.8        |
| NACA-TN-1855   | 1949 | 0.8        |

Different implementations of theory had differing values. 
By 1949, interpretations of test data had arrived at the 
values in Appendix C. 
There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949.  

### Recent data comparison to Appendix C  

More recent icing data with more recent instrumentation compares well to the 
70+ year-old NACA data.  

Figure 1 of Cober and Isaac [^7] is one example. It is copy-righted, but available on-line. 
While not every data point is within the Appendix C envelope, 
the differences have not been viewed as large enough to require revising the Appendix C regulation.  

## Conclusions  

The current Appendix C icing regulations are largely based on NACA flight tests and 
publications that were completed by 1952. 

The data and recommendations from the NACA-era have held up remarkably well. 

There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949.  
Several factors had come together to make that possible. 
A vital need was recognized. 
Multiple agencies were coordinated (NACA, Army Air Force, Weather Bureau, industry, academia). 
Test aircraft with robust ice protection were available (see [Engine Exhaust Heat]({filename}engine%20exhaust%20heat.md)). 
[Improved icing instruments]({filename}instruments.md) were being developed. 

The icing design requirements are another crowning achievement of the NACA-era.
