## Abstract

>  Evaluation of the rotating multicylinder method for the
measurement of droplet-size distribution, volume-median droplet
size, and liquid-water content in clouds showed that small 
uncertainties in the basic data eliminate the distinction between
different cloud droplet-size distributions and are a source of
large errors in the determination of the droplet size. Calculations 
of the trajectories of cloud droplets in incompressible and
compressible flow fields around a cylinder were performed on a
mechanical analog constructed for the study of the trajectories of
droplets around aerodynamic bodies. Many data points were
carefully calculated in order to determine precisely the rate of
droplet impingement on the surface of a right circular cylinder.
From the computed droplet trajectories, the following impingement 
characteristics of the cylinder surface were obtained and
are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters: (1) total
rate of water impingement, (2) extent of droplet impingement
zone, and (3) local distribution of impinging water on cylinder
surface.

> The rotating multicylinder method for in-flight determination
of liquid-water content, droplet size, and droplet-size distribution
in icing clouds is described. The theory of operation, the
apparatus required, the technique of obtaining data in fight,
and detailed methods of calculating the results, including
necessary charts and tables, are presented. An evaluation of
the multicylinder method includes the effect on final results of
droplets that do not freeze completely on the cylinders after
striking them, as well as probable errors in final results caused
by the inherent insensitivity of the multicylinder method.

## Discussion

This review focuses on the thermodynamic aspects, 
see a more general review at [NACA-TR-1215]({filename}NACA-TR-1215.md).  

### Droplets that do not freeze completely

The significant part that NACA-TR-1215 adds 
is the effect of water drops that do not completely freeze. 
Building on the work of Ludlam [^2] and others, an analysis method was detailed in Appendix F. 

![Symbols 1](images/naca-tr-1215/Symbols1.png)  
![Symbols 2](images/naca-tr-1215/Symbols2.png)  

![Assumptions](images/naca-tr-1215/Assumptions.png)

To put the analysis results in terms useful for multicylinder analysis, 
the ambient liquid water content is split into the portions that freeze, evaporate, 
and liquid water that does not freeze and presumably runs off of the cylinder. 
The term LWC_freeze\*Em (or wf\*Em) is proportional to the rotating cylinder ice mass, 
and it is plotted with cylinder diameter, similar to the plots used for the manual 
determination of best fit MVD, LWC and distribution that we have seen previously. 

Detailed heat equations start with convection: 

![Equation F3](images/naca-tr-1215/EquationF3.png)  

And freezing: 

![Equation F4](images/naca-tr-1215/EquationF4.png)  

And evaporation, 
and then all equations are combined in F10 to predict the
"critical line" (the maximum water rate that can all freeze):

![Equation F8 to F10](images/naca-tr-1215/EquationsF8toF10.png)  

Figure 24 shows cases where the cylinder masses are well below the critical line (a),
some masses are affected (b and c), and all cylinders are affected (d).  

![Figure 24. Examples illustrating effect of run-off on multicylinder data.](images/naca-tr-1215/Figure24.png)

Also shown in Figure 24 is a "run-off" line:  
> For observations in discontinuous clouds, points representing 
critical or super-critical conditions lie approximately along a line called the
"run-off line," which is located parallel to and generally
below the critical line, because the effect on the average
value of wf*Ew of the term containing Î» is nearly always
smaller than the effect of discontinuities (gaps) in the cloud.

Data affected by run-off may still be useful in some circumstances:

> If multicylinder data taken under conditions of partial
run-off are analyzed by the ordinary method without reference 
to the possible occurrence of run-off, the results usually
indicate values of liquid-water content that are too small
and values of mean effective droplet diameter that are too
large. This occurs because, under ordinary flight and cloud
conditions, run-off occurs first from the smallest cylinders.
For very large droplets, on the other hand, run-off occurs
first from the largest cylinder and thus would tend to cause
underestimation of the droplet size.

> The methods described in the preceding paragraphs make
possible the attainment of satisfactory results in many cases
in which one or two cylinders are affected by run-off. Observations 
from which reliable results are unobtainable can
also be recognized and rejected.

The equations were programmed in the file "naca_tr_1215_find_critical_line.py" [^3]. 

I did not attempt to implement Equation F10 directly. 
Instead, the heat terms are collected and an LWC value found 
iteratively to satisfy the mass and energy balance. 

    q_conv = pi * h * (ts - tk - u ** 2 / 2 / CP_AIR * (1 - u1 ** 2 / u ** 2 * (1 - r)))
    q_evap = (pi * h * RATIO_MOLECULAR_WEIGHTS / CP_AIR * L_EVAPORATION * (calc_vapor_p(ts) - calc_vapor_p(tk)) / p)
    q_sensible = em * lwc / CP_AIR * u * WATER_SPECIFIC_HEAT * (ts - tk)
    q_kinetic = -em * lwc / CP_AIR * u * u ** 2 / 2
    q_freezing = q_conv + q_evap + q_sensible + q_kinetic

    mf = qf / L_FREEZING
    me = q_evap / L_EVAPORATION
    mc = lwc / G_PER_KG * em * u
    
    find lwc so that
    mc - mf - me = 0

Note the term pi in the convection and evaporation terms. 
The entire surface of the cylinder is considered to be fully wet and contribute to
convection and evaporation, with a surface extent of pi*diameter 
[diameter is common to all of the heat terms, and so may be algebraically eliminated]. 
The entire surface is also considered to be at one temperature, 0C. 

The critical line (only) was calculated. 

The run-off line was apparently surmised manually, 
with the logic that if more than one cylinder mass is at or below the critical line, 
and the apparently limited masses follow a -0.253 slope on the log-log plot. 
The -0.253 slope comes from the heat transfer relationship used, 
nu = 0.082*re^0.747, so -0.253 = 0.747 - 1 . 

Figure 24a has no run-off line, and none of the cylinder freezing rates appear to be limited. 

![Figure 24a calculated values](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24a_critical.png)  

For Figure 24b, the smaller two cylinders appear to be limited, 
and the run-off line is close to the critical line. 

![Figure 24b calculated values](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24b_critical.png)  

For Figure 24c, the smaller two cylinders appear to be limited, 
and the run-off line is further below the critical line than in Figure 24b. 

![Figure 24c calculated values](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24c_critical.png)  

In Figure 24d, all of the cylinder freezing rates are limited, 
and the run-off line is close to the critical line. 

![Figure 24d calculated values](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24d_critical.png)  

In Appendix F the value for Ul/U is given as: 

>The value 1.12 used for the ratio Ul/U was obtained from
measurements made in calibrating the multicylinder exposure
used on the C-46 airplane by the Ames laboratory (ref. 33).

However, it is not clear that that the 1.12 value was used for all cases in Figure 24. 
For cases b and d, the results calculated with the python implementation agree better 
with a ratio of Ul/U=1. 
The difference in results with Ul/U=1 versus Ul/U=1.12 is small, about 0.02 g/m^3, 
and the python results agree with the Figure 24 results within that tolerance. 

## Conclusions

> Multicylinder
results obtained with limitations on ice-accretion rates may
be in error by a magnitude as large as the measurements, if
the effect of run-off is not evaluated. Run-off is a factor in
determining the volume-median droplet size and the liquid-water 
content. If run-off is not recognized in the analysis of
the data, the measured data points are incorrectly matched
to the theoretically calculated matching curves.  

## Ludlam limits

When we compare the various ["Ludlam limits"]({filename}ludlam.md) for rotating cylinders that we have seen before, 
some compare well to the test results, and some do not. 

The NACA-TR-1215 method compares to the measured data very well. 
I find this level of agreement compelling. 

The [Messinger]({filename}messinger.md) method [^4] with the same heat transfer relationship as NACA-TR-1215 
(nu = 0.082*re^0.747) compares well to the test data. 

The Messinger methods with other heat transfer relationships do not compare well. 

The Fraser [^5] method does not compare well with the test data, and is comparable the the Messinger results with the same heat transfer relationship
(nu = 0.24*re^0.6). 

The Ludlam method compares well in some cases (24c and 24c), but not in others. 
The lack of viscous heating in the Ludlam method contributes to the differences. 

![Figure 24a calculated Ludlam limits](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24a_critical_plus.png)  

![Figure 24b calculated Ludlam limits](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24b_critical_plus.png)  

![Figure 24c calculated Ludlam limits](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24c_critical_plus.png)  

![Figure 24d calculated Ludlam limits](images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24d_critical_plus.png)  

The LTR-LT-92 method [^6] has been added to the rotating cylinder "Ludlam limits". 
Figure 7 of LTR-LT-92 gives critical LWC values for a 0.002489 m diameter cylinder (only),
and is plotted here as 0.1 inch diameter. 
The LTR-LT-92 method does not compare well to the flight test data. 
The LTR-LT-92 method assumes that only the impingement region 
(approximately the front half of the cylinder) contributes to convection and evaporation. 
While the values do not compare well to this flight test data, 
they may be viewed as "conservative" in that if the values are used as LWC limits, 
any measurements will be well below the critical line and the run-off lines, 
but many legitimate measurements might be questioned. 

![LTR-LT-92 Figure 7.](images/ltr_lt_92/Figure7.png)  

It appears that there were two essential elements of an analysis to well match the flight test rotating cylinder freezing rate values:
1. Evaporation and convection occur on the entire surface of the cylinder.  
2. A roughness-enhanced heat transfer relationship (nu = 0.024 * re^0.747)
