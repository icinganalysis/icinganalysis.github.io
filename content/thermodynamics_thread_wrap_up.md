#Conclusions of the Icing Thermodynamics Thread 

##Summary  
Data from the post-NACA era are used to resolve open questions 

##Key points
1. The Icing Thermodynamics thread is summarized
2. Post-NACA era data is used to resolve some open questions.
3. NACA era data that are still used today are summarized

##Discussion

###Review of the Icing Thermodynamics thread so far

In the Icing Thermodynamics thread, we saw:

- Calculations of wet surface temperatures [NACA-ARR-5G13]({filename}NACA-ARR-5G13.md)  
- Two dimensional heated surface equations for ice protection [NACA-TR-381]({filename}NACA-TR-381.md)  
- Comparisons of natural icing flight data to 2D ice protection calculations [NACA-TN-1472]({filename}NACA-TN-1472.md)
- The "Ludlam limit" for freezing all water impinging [Ludlam, F. H.: The Heat Economy of a Rimed Cylinder]({filename}ludlam.md)  
- The term "freezing fraction" defined [Messinger, B. L.: “Equilibrium Temperature of an Unheated Icing Surface as a Function of Airspeed”]({filename}messinger.md)  
- Graphical solutions of ice protection equations [Simple Graphical Solution of Heat Transfer and Evaporation from Surface Heated to Prevent Icing]({filename}NACA-TN-2799.md)  
- The warmest ambient temperature at which ice can accumulate [NACA-TN-2861]({filename}NACA-TN-2914.md), and [NACA-TN-2914]({filename}NACA-TN-2914.md)  
- Evidence for "Ludlam limits" for icing instruments [Fraser, D.: "Thermodynamic Limitations of Ice Accretion Instruments"]({filename}Fraser.md)  
- Less that 1% of water drops evaporate approaching an obstacle [NACA-TN-3024]({filename}NACA-TN-3024.md)  
- Detailed analysis of the ratio of heat transfer to mass transfer [NACA-TN-3045]({filename}NACA-TN-3045.md)  
- Measurements of sublimation rates at Mach 1.3 [NACA-TN-3104]({filename}NACA-TN-3104.md)  
- Measurements and analysis of the "Ludlam limit" for rotating cylinders [NACA-TR-1215]({filename}NACA-TR-1215.md)  
- Experimental verification of the warmest temperature at which ice can accumulate [NACA-TN-3396]({filename}NACA-TN-3396.md)  
- The summary of the NACA-era thermodynamics [FAA-ADS-4](FAA-ADS-4.md)  

And several programs in the Python programming language are available to reproduce the results in several cases [^2]. 

##Open questions

We will look at some data from the post-NACA era to help resolve these questions. 

1. Which of the various "Ludlam limits" is most accurate?
