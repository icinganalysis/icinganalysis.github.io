> ###"... the rotating-cylinder indications of drop-size distribution are so unreliable that they are of little or no value"

#"Observations of Icing Conditions Encountered in Flight During 1948"  
[^1]

##Key points

1. The average liquid water content varies over distance traveled in icing.
2. The value of the multicylinder method for determining drop size distributions is questioned.

##Abstract

>    Meteorological data from flight observations in icing conditions
during the first 5 months of 1948 are presented. A total of 335
measurements of liquid-water content and mean-effective drop diameter
were obtained by the multicylinder method in the course of 40 flights
in icing conditions covering most of northern United States. Cumulus
clouds were predominant during approximately two-thirds of the flights.
A continuous record of liquid-water content covering a major portion
of the operations was obtained by means of a rotating-disk icing-rate
meter. This record was used to investigate the relation between average 
liquid-water content and the horizontal extent of icing conditions.
An analysis of values of maximum drop diameter calculated from the
area of drop impingement on a stationary cylinder and corresponding
values of mean-effective drop diameter and dropsize distribution as
obtained from the rotating cylinders led to the conclusion that the
rotating-cylinder indications of drop-size distribution are so unre-
liable that they are of little or no value. The data indicate that
average and maximum values of drop size are significantly greater
and more variable near the Pacific coast than in the other parts of
the United States included in this investigation.
    

##Discussion

###Variation in liquid water content with distance

Data was gathered in icing clouds in flight, with flight paths that were often not straight lines.

The data were summarized in a table.

The data were shown in Figure 5.

1000 flights encountering icing, assuming that 5 percent of flights encounter cumulous
clouds.](images/naca-tn-1904/Figure5.png)

###Drop size distributions

Note above _"the conclusion that the rotating-cylinder indications of drop-size distribution are so unreliable that they are of little or no value"_ (!)

This was based on a comparison of maximum drop size a determined by a stationary cylinder to the mean-effective drop diameter and best fit distribution determined by the multicylinder method.
The mean-effective drop diameter is noted as "The amount of water in all of the drops greater than the mean-effective diameter is equal to the ".

    γ = (maximum drop size from fixed) / (mean-effective drop diameter from rotating multicylinder)
    
![Drop size ratios](images/naca-tn-1904/drop%20size%20ratios.png)

However, as we saw in [NACA-RM-A9C09]({filename}NACA-RM-A9C09.md) [^2], 
the error in estimating maximum drop size from maximum impingement limit on a fixed cylinder 
is as large as the error determining the MVD from the multicylinder method, 
so the maximum drop size determined may not be so reliable of a value to compare with.  

In the later NACA-TR-1215 [^3] (of which William Lewis was also an author of) a more nuanced view of the drop size distribution 
determination will be found.

Also note that the determination of the mean-effective drop diameter (MED) is not disputed, only the distribution determination is disputed.

###Multicylinder accuracy

Figure 7 essentially reproduces Figure 2 of [NACA-RM-A9C09]({filename}NACA-TN-1904.md) [^2], 
the results of which are largely reproducible as noted in that review.

the weight of ice accretions on the rotating cylinders, and +5 degrees in determining
of the angle of the water imingement (theta_m) on the nonrotating cylinder
