#"Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications" now posts on the Mastodon social network.  

You do not need an account to view the posts, 
they are available at [mstdn.social/@icinganalysis](https://mstdn.social/@icinganalysis). 

If you have an ActivityPub or "fediverse" social media account, you can follow 
@icinganalysis@mstdn.social.

At the moment, the posts are "old" ones (aren't they all?), 
but they will eventually (over several weeks) catch up to the current posts. 

I do plan to continue posting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-cook-96204316a/). 
Mastodon may well reach a different audience.
