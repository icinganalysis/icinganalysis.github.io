# "Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications" now posts on the Mastodon social network.  

You do not need an account to view the posts, 
they are available at [historians.social/@icinganalysis](https://historians.social/@icinganalysis). 

If you have an ActivityPub or "fediverse" social media account, you can follow 
@icinganalysis@historians.social.

At the moment, the posts are "old" ones (aren't they all?), 
but they will eventually (over several weeks) catch up to the current posts. 

I do plan to continue posting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-cook-96204316a/). 
Mastodon may well reach a different audience.  

You can learn more about Mastodon at [docs.joinmastodon.org](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/).  

Note: an earlier edit of this post had a different address for Mastodon. 
I have since changed instances. 
The community on historians.social is a better fit for this than a general use instance. 
Switching instances is a normal thing in the fediverse.
