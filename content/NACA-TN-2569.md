## Abstract  

>SUMMARY  
Data from various sources on the observed values of meteorological 
variables, liquid-water content, mean-effective droplet size, and temperature, 
which are pertinent to aircraft icing, are summarized; and a
method is proposed for the selection of design criterions for ice-protection 
equipment.  
The data are divided according to two broad cloud types, namely,
stratiform and cumuliform clouds, because the physical dimensions, the
formation and development processes, the frequency of encounter, and
the severity of icing conditions are very different for the two cloud
types. The data are summarized in such a manner as to give the frequency 
of occurrence of observed icing conditions according to two of
the pertinent meteorological variables. The summarized data indicate
that statistical relations exist between liquid-water content, mean-effective 
droplet diameter, temperature, and pressure altitude.  
The proposed method of selecting values of liquid-water content
and mean-effective droplet diameter as design criterions for ice-protection 
equipment is based upon the collection efficiency of an airfoil 
as a function of droplet size and the frequency of occurrence of
icing situations with various liquid-water-contents and mean-effective
droplet diameters. The method provides a convenient means of calculating
the percentage of icing encounters in which the water-collection rate
exceeds the design rate for the ice-protection equipment and also illustrates 
the desirability of sometimes designing ice-protection equipment
for water-collection rates which are less than the maximum rate
expected. The method is illustrated by the selection of design criterions 
for ice-protection equipment for a hypothetical, 12-percent
thick, low-drag airfoil with a chord length of 15.8 feet; however, the
method may be employed for any airfoil provided the collection efficiency
is known.

## Discussion  

This is a fairly long publication (33 pages). 
For brevity, only the comments about icing in stratiform clouds will be detailed.  

> INTRODUCTION  
For several years research has been conducted on the prevention
and removal of ice formations caused by supercooled clouds on components
of aircraft by the addition of heat to the vulnerable components. In
order to evaluate the heat requirements of an ice-prevention system that
provides adequate protection against icing caused by supercooled clouds,
the rate at which supercooled liquid cloud droplets are collected by
each portion of the surface of the airplane, the probable maximum duration, 
and the frequency of occurrence of various icing conditions must
be known. The evaluation of these unknowns requires the following
information about supercooled clouds: (1) liquid-water content,
(2) droplet diameter and droplet-size distribution, (3) air temperature
and pressure, (4) horizontal and vertical extent of icing situations,
and (5) frequency of occurrence of icing conditions of a given 
description.  
Incomplete information concerning the fundamental physical processes 
that determine the structure of clouds and cloud systems has
necessitated an experimental and statistical approach to the definition
of the important features of an icing cloud. Flights have been made by
the NACA and other agencies with instrumented aircraft through supercooled 
clouds for the past several years in order to establish, for the
pertinent meteorological variables, the range of values encountered in
icing conditions. As a result 
of these instrumented flights, a considerable accumulation of 
meteorological data pertinent to the icing
problem has been obtained and published.  
As part of the NACA Lewis laboratory icing-research program, this
report summarizes the existing meteorological data from various sources
and proposes a method of selecting design criterions for ice-protection
equipment. The data are summarized in such a manner as to give the
frequency of occurrence of icing situations with a given combination of
two of the principal meteorological variables. These frequencies of
occurrence are used in combination with water-collection rates for an
aircraft component as a basis for the proposed method of selecting
design criterions for ice-protection equipment. This method gives a
convenient means of determining the percentage of icing encounters in
which the water-collection rate exceeds the collection rate for which
the ice-protection system is designed. The method is illustrated by the
selection of design criterions for ice-protection equipment for a hypothetical, 
12-percent thick, low-drag airfoil with a chord length of
15.8 feet.

>Cloud Droplet Diameter as Function of Pressure Altitude  
A component or an airfoil of an aircraft in flight through a
cloud usually does not intercept all the droplets in its path, because
some of the droplets are deflected around the airfoil by the air flow.
The percentage of droplets intercepted depends on; among other factors,
the droplet size and increases with increasing droplet size if all
other factors are constant. Because the percentage catch, and therefore 
the rate of ice accumulation, are functions of droplet size, any
relation between droplet size and pressure altitude is of importance,
for possibly the altitude of severest aircraft icing would not coincide
with the altitude of maximum liquid-water content indicated by figure 1.  
Data collected during icing survey flights indicate that cloud
droplets in a given icing situation are not always uniform in size but
may be distributed over a wide range of sizes. Because the droplet-size
distribution may influence the rate of ice accumulation on various areas
of an airfoil, it should be employed in the design calculations for
ice-protection equipment. The introduction of this factor, however,
greatly complicates the design calculations; therefore it has not been
used extensively. The mean-effective droplet diameter has been employed
instead. Furthermore, some doubt exists as to the validity of the
droplet-size distribution measurements.

various increments of liquid-water content and pressure
altitude. (Numbers given indicate number of icing conditions

>Bivariate frequency-distribution charts of mean-effective droplet
diameter as a function of pressure altitude for icing conditions in
stratiform and cumuliform clouds with curves of maximum and average
values of mean-effective droplet diameter are presented in figures 2(a)
and 2(b). If the one observation in the altitude range 0 to 2000 feet
in stratiform clouds (fig. 2(a)) is regarded as insufficient data for
average-mean-effective-droplet-diameter calculations, then the average
and maximum values of mean-effective droplet diameter are very similar
for the two cloud types. The average value of mean-effective droplet
diameter for any given altitude for cumuliform clouds is in general from
1 to 4 microns larger than for stratiform clouds. For both cloud types
the over-all average mean-effective droplet diameter is higher in the
pressure-altitude range of 10,000 to 20,000 feet than in the range of
0 to 10,000 feet.

>SELECTION OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS FOR ICE-PROTECTION-SYSTEM DESIGN  
Because the amount of heat required by ice-protection systems of
high-speed jet aircraft to evaporate all the intercepted supercooled
water from the vulnerable components is often very large, it may be
necessary to design ice-protection equipment for some components for
icing conditions of less severity than the maximum expected in order to
keep the heat requirements to acceptable values. This may be particularly 
necessary if the probability of encountering the severest icing
condition is very low and the heat required for protection for this
situation is several times that required for the most probable icing
condition.  
> This approach to ice-protection equipment design may be feasible,
because severe icing situations are usually those with high liquid-water
content and therefore generally of short horizontal extent (fig. 5);
and some components with high heat requirements, such as wings, can
often tolerate small accumulations of ice for short periods of tine
without excessive airplane performance losses. Data obtained during the
recent Thunderstorm Project (reference 10) on icing conditions in cumuliform 
clouds is of interest in this connection. A total of 305 traverses
of cumuliform clouds by P-61C airplanes were made in icing conditions,
and on no occasion did ice accumulate before the end of a traverse to
such an extent as to make safe flight impossible. Inasmuch as these
flights were made with relatively slow airplanes with reciprocating
engines, no direct conclusions can be drawn from these flights regarding
safety of flight through cumuliform clouds with high liquid-water content 
by jet-powered aircraft other than that it may be possible to fly
in icing conditions which will overload the ice-protection system for
short periods of time without loss of control before emerging into
clear air or less severe icing conditions. For jet-powered aircraft
with thin high-speed wings, the amount of ice that can be tolerated
may be considerably less than that for low-speed wings. In addition,
critical components such as turbine-engine inlets must be kept ice free
at all times; and ice-protection equipment for these components must be
designed to cope with the maximum icing conditions anticipated. In
general, these critical areas do not require a large percentage of the
total heat requirements.

observations for various increments of
temperature and pressure altitude. (Numbers

>Extent of Icing Condition  
Although data on horizontal and vertical extent of icing conditions 
are limited, sufficient data have been obtained to indicate the
order of magnitude of these icing variables. 
The maximum horizontal extent of icing situations with a given
average liquid-water content is presented in figure 5. The dashed curve
is an estimate of the probable maximum horizontal extent of winter icing
situations with a given average, liquid-water content as proposed in
reference 5. The solid curve is an envelope of the maximum distance
flown in icing conditions with a given average liquid-water content, as
measured and reported by reference 4, for 57 flights in icing conditions
during four winter icing seasons from 1946 to 1950. The curves of figure 5 
are similar and show an inverse relation between average liquid-water 
content and maximum horizontal extent of icing situations. The
majority of observations on which the estimated curve is based were
taken in cumuliform clouds, whereas a large majority of observations on
which the measured curve is based were in stratiform clouds. This difference 
probably accounts for the higher liquid-water content indicated
for short distances by the estimated curve, as the liquid-water content
is usually higher in cumuliform clouds than stratiform clouds.

>SELECTION OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS FOR ICE-PROTECTION-SYSTEM DESIGN  
Because the amount of heat required by ice-protection systems of
high-speed jet aircraft to evaporate all the intercepted supercooled
water from the vulnerable components is often very large, it may be
necessary to design ice-protection equipment for some components for
icing conditions of less severity than the maximum expected in order to
keep the heat requirements to acceptable values. This may be particularly 
necessary if the probability of encountering the severest icing
condition is very low and the heat required for protection for this
situation is several times that required for the most probable icing
condition.  

>In order to evaluate the rate of water interception by a component, 
the collection efficiency of the component must be known. The
collection efficiency of an airfoil, defined as the ratio of the water
intercepted by the component to the total mass of water in the volume
swept out by the moving airfoil at zero geometric angle of attack, is a
function of the physical dimensions of the airfoil, the airspeed, and
the angle of attack as well as the meteorological variables: droplet
size, air temperature, and pressure. The air temperature and pressure
enter into the relation indirectly as parameters determining the viscosity 
and density of the air. The collection efficiency of an airfoil
can be obtained, from droplet trajectory calculations such as those 
presented in reference 11.  

> This approach to the design of ice-protection equipment can best
be presented by means of an example. Assume that the probability of
encountering an icing situation with a given rate of water interception
is desired for a hypothetical, 12-percent thick, low-drag airfoil with
a chord length of 15.8 feet for a climb condition from O to 20,000 feet
at 350 miles per hour. Estimates of the collection efficiency as a
function of droplet size for such a hypothetical airfoil for two operating 
and meteorological conditions are presented in figure 6.

![Figure 6. Variations of collection efficiency with droplet diameter
for a hypothetical,  12-percent thick, low-drag airfoil with a chord 
length of 15.8 feet for two altitude, temperature, and 
angle-of-attack conditions.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2569%2FFigure%206.png)  

>Curves of constant water-collection rates as functions of liquid-water 
content and droplet size for the two pressure-altitude ranges of
the two cloud types are shown in figure 7. These curves are superimposed 
upon the data of figure 3. The percentage of icing encounters
with water-collection rates less than a given value for a given cloud
type and pressure-altitude range is given by the ratio of the sum of
the icing encounters in the region below and to the left of a given
water-collection-rate curve to the total number of icing encounters for
the given cloud type and pressure-altitude range.
Cumulative frequency curves of the percentage of icing encounters
with rates of water collection less than a given value for the four
cloud classifications of figure 7 obtained in the preceding manner are
presented in figure 8. The water-collection rate increases very rapidly
above 90 percent of all encounters. It may therefore be desirable to
exploit the tolerance of various components to small quantities of ice
accumulations and the small frequency of occurrence of severe icing
conditions in order to keep the heat requirements to acceptable values.
A comparison of the cumulative frequency curves for stratiform clouds
(figs. 8(a) and 8(c)) with those for cumuliform clouds (figs. 8(b)
and 8(d)) shows that an ice-protection system designed for a given
water-collection rate will provide a much higher percentage of protection
for flights in icing conditions in stratiform clouds than in cumuliform
clouds. However, if only 5 percent of all icing encounters during routine 
flight operation occur in cumuliform clouds (reference 9), then the
probability of encountering an icing situation during routine flight
with a water-collection rate higher than the design rate is only slightly
higher than that calculated for icing encounters for stratiform clouds
alone.

## Conclusions  

>CONCLUDING REMARKS  
Data on the range of values of the meteorological variables pertinent 
to the aircraft icing problem have been summarized and a method
has been proposed for the selection of design criterions for ice-protection 
equipment of the continuous heat type that evaporates the
intercepted water. The summarized data indicate that statistical relations 
exist between liquid-water content, mean-effective droplet diameter, 
temperature, and pressure altitude. Therefore, when electing
values of these parameters as design values, caution should be exercised
because individual values of these parameters could be selected that,
when considered alone, appear to be reasonable, but would occur very
seldom in combination in an icing situation. The proposed method of
selecting design criterions is based upon the collection efficiency of
the airfoil as a function of droplet size and the frequency of occurrence 
of icing situations with various liquid-water, contents and mean-effective 
droplet sizes. The method provides a convenient means of 
calculating the percentage of icing encounters in which the ice-collection 
rate exceeds the design rate for the ice-protection equipment.
The method also illustrates the desirability of exploiting the tolerance
of various components to small quantities of ice accumulations, because
the frequency of encounter of icing situations with extremely high ice-collection 
rates is low. Ice-protection equipment for some critical
aircraft components, such as turbine-engine inlets, should, however, be
designed for approximately the severest ice-collection rates expected.
For airplanes equipped with ice-protection equipment which is designed
for ice-collection rates less than the maximum expected, meteorological
forecasting and navigation will have to be employed to avoid the extreme
conditions or the aircraft will have to be operated on the assumption
that the ice-protection equipment for the noncritical components can be
overloaded for a short time until the aircraft emerges into clear air
or less severe conditions.
