## Abstract  

>SUMMARY  
> 
>A photographic technique for investigating water droplets of diameter 
less than 200 microns falling freely in air at temperatures between
0° C and -50° C has been devised and used to determine:  
(1) The shape of frozen droplets  
(2) The occurrence of collisions of partly frozen or of frozen and
liquid droplets  
(3) The statistics on the freezing temperatures of individual
free-falling droplets  
> 
>A considerable number of droplets were found to have a non-spherical
shape after freezing because of various protuberances and frost growth,
and droplet aggregates formed by collision. The observed frequency of
collision of partly frozen droplets showed good order of magnitude agreement 
with the frequency computed from theoretical collection efficiencies. 
The freezing temperature statistics indicated a general
similarity of the data to those obtained for droplets frozen on a metallic 
surface in previous experiments.  

## Discussion  

>APPARATUS  
> 
>A schematic drawing of the apparatus for observing the presence of
frozen droplets among free-falling droplets is shown in figure 1. The
entire apparatus, with the exception of the temperature recording device,
was housed in a large cold chamber (inside dimensions approximately
10 ft long, 7 ft wide, and 10 ft high). A photograph of the apparatus
in place in the large cold chamber is shown in figure 2. The apparatus
consisted of a heated spray chamber from which droplets settled into a
cooled 4- by 4-inch vertical duct. The cooled droplets were photographed
with a cmera and spark source as they passed windows at the bottom of
the duct after a 4-foot fall. Provision was made for pumping air out
through one end of the spray chamber, so that an upward flow of cold air
from the cold chamber could be imposed in the vertical duct.  
> 
>The spray chamber was kept at temperatures above freezing by a
copper steam pipe soldered to the walls of the chamber. Similarly, in
order to prevent the water pipes from freezing, the steam pipes were
conducted to and from the spray chamber in contact with the water lines.
The heated portions of the apparatus were insulated with felt to minimize
heat losses. Both the spray chamber and vertical duct were made from
Inconel metal to avoid corrosion.

>Thermocouples were installed in the spray nozzles for measuring the
water temperature. The air temperature in the cold vertical duct was
measured at three vertical positions (top, center, and camera level) by
pumping air from the duct past thermocouples housed in 3/4-inch diameter
tubes attached to a wall of the duct. Glass-wool filters prevented
stray droplets from striking the thermocouples. The mass-flow rate of
the air pumped from the duct was obtained from the area of the
thermocouple-housing tube and the local static pressure in the housing
tube measured by a micromanometer. Low mass-flow rates were used in
order not to disturb appreciably the air in the duct. The temperatures
were recorded on a strip-chart self-balancing potentiometer placed outside the large cold chamber.  
> 
>The lens of the camera used to photograph the cooled droplets was
similar to those used in motion-picture cameras and had a focal ratio of
f/2.8 and a focal length of 2 inches. The depth of field was approximately 
0.4 millimeter and the volume of field was 0.036 cubic centimeter. 
The image distance was approximately 44 inches and the magnification was 22X. 
The depth of field and the magnification were measured
by taking photographs of a group of fine quartz fibers placed successively 
at greater distances from the face of the camera lens. The
accuracy of the diameter measurements varies from ±5 percent at
100 microns to ±10 percent at 10 microns. Bright field illumination
was furnished by a spark source located on the opposite side of the
vertical duct from the camera. The spark source and its power supply
are described in references 8 and 9. The spark duration was approximately 
2 microseconds, which was a sufficiently short exposure time to
yield sharp droplet images.  
> 
>Droplet photographs were taken with fast orthochromatic 8- by 10-
inch film. Long development time (10 min) was found to be necessary in
order to give sufficient contrast. The images of the droplets appeared
on the negatives as white areas on a dark background. Many of the droplet 
images had dark spots in the center, which were images of the spark
source formed by the droplets. A positive photograph of the droplets at
room temperature taken with this apparatus is shown in figure 3.
An upward flow of cold air from the chamber could be imposed in the
vertical duct in order to slow the rate of fall of the droplets and
thereby to obtain a longer cooling time before the droplets were photographed. 
The air outlet from the spray chamber narrowed from a 4- by
4-inch cross-sectional area in the duct to 1- by 1-inch. Thus the airflow 
velocity was increased in the constricted portion of the outlet to
a value which could be measured by total and static tubes connected to a
micromanometer.

>PROCEDURE  
> 
>Droplet temperature. - A direct measurement of droplet-temperature
was not possible with the apparatus just described, but a computation
of how close a droplet of a given size will approach the cold air temperature 
of the duct in dropping from the warm spray chamber to the
camera window level in the vertical duct (127 cm) was possible. The
method used for making these computations is described in appendix A.
The computed results are summarized in figure 4, which indicates that
droplets 200 microns or less in diameter have a temperature negligibly
different from air temperature at camera level in the duct. The duct
air temperatures measured by the thermocouples at the midpoint and at
camera level were usually the same (within 1° C). The temperature
measured by the upper thermocouple was somewhat higher (2° to 3° C)
because of the proximity of the heated spray chamber.

>Detection of frozen droplets. - In addition to determining the temperature 
of the droplets it was desirable to find a means of differentiating 
a frozen droplet from a supercooled liquid droplet. A previous
investigation showed that a droplet suspended from a thermocouple and
observed in bright field illumination generally forms a crude image of
the light source, which appears in the positive photographs as a bright
spot at the center of the dark circular droplet image. The freezing
of a supercooled droplet thus suspended was detected by the disappearance 
or marked decrease in intensity of the bright spot at the center
of the droplet image in an investigation in 1948 by John C. Johnson at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Investigations at the NACA
Lewis laboratory substantiate this method for use with droplets suspended 
from a thermocouple. Because similar bright spots occur in the
images of free falling droplets photographed with the camera, an attempt
was made to use the foregoing criterion for determining when free-falling droplets were frozen.  
> 
>An examination of the droplet images on the photographic negatives
disclosed that a considerable portion of the images had a noncircular
outline. For reasons, discussed in the Results and Discussion section,
these noncircular images were considered to be indicative of frozen
droplets. However, considerable numbers of these noncircular images
had bright spots at the center. This obvious contradiction coupled with
the apparent reliability of the noncircular image criterion eliminated
frozen-droplet detection by the bright spot method. Although noncircular 
droplet images are definite indicators of frozen droplets, an
unknown portion of circular droplets may also be frozen. Circular
images may be produced by nonspherical (and thus frozen) droplets
because of their particular orientation to the camera. Inasmuch as
neither the portion of the circular droplet images that are due to
unfrozen spherical droplets nor the portion due to droplets that are
frozen and remained spherical is known, any absolute estimate of the
ratio of frozen to unfrozen droplets in a particular sample is impossible. 
An appraisal of the ratio of noncircular droplets to the sum of
the circular plus noncircular droplets was therefore made as the best
means available to detect droplet freezing trends.  

>Range of conditions. - Droplet photographs were taken at various
temperatures ranging from 0° to -51° C. A group of droplet photographs
were also taken at room temperature (approximately 20° C) for comparison 
with those taken at temperatures below 0° C. For droplets between
46 and 200 microns in diameter, the temperature range below 0° C was
completely covered by photographs taken with an updraft velocity in the
duct of approximately 7 centimeters per second (terminal velocity for a
46-micron droplet). Because of current interest in the rate of formation 
of ice crystals in the temperature region of -40° C, the temperature 
range from -36° to -48.5° C was also covered by droplet photographs
taken with no updraft in the duct. For this range, inasmuch as no
updraft was used, it was possible to extend the lower limit of the droplet 
diameter range from 46 to 5 microns.  
> 
>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
> 
>Shape of frozen droplets. - Observations at room temperature indicated 
unfrozen droplet images were always circular in outline (fig. 3).
In photographs of droplets below -20° C, a considerable number of noncircular 
droplet images was noted (fig. 5). In general, two broad
types of noncircular droplet image were observed: type I, images of
aggregates of droplets that apparently froze together (for example,
droplets 5, 6, and 7 of fig. 6 and 5 of fig. 7); type II, images of
irregularly shaped droplets with various types of protuberance (for
example, droplets 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 21, and 24 of fig. 6). Many images
were found that were combinations of the two types (such as droplet
33, fig. 6).

![Figure 5. Droplet images obtained at a temperature of -39° C. Approximately 10X.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E51L17%2FFigure%205.png)  
_I believe that some drop images are circled with an ink marker._

![Figure 7. Droplets frozen while falling freely in column of air with updraft of 7 centimeters 
per second and air temperature range of -25° to -51° C. Approximately 70X.](/images%2FNACA-RM-E51L17%2FFigure%207.png)  
_The quality of the scanned image is poor._  

>The droplet images have been classified with respect to size and
type of image and the results are tabulated in tables I and II. The
images that were considered as combinations of the two types were
included in the type I group. The sorting of droplet images into
type I and type II categories was complicated by the poor definition of
the smaller protuberances in the photographs making the boundary line
between the two types rather indistinct. The noncircular droplet
images were therefore examined with a low powered microscope and only
those irregularities which had a definitely circular outline were considered 
as caused by collision. The remaining protuberances were
included in the type II group.   
> 
>Computations of probabilities of collisions between droplets of
different sizes and hence different terminal velocities have been made
(appendix B). These computations yielded results consistent with the
hypothesis that type I images are the result of collisions between
partly frozen droplets. The type II images were probably caused by
droplets that were distorted because of internal forces created during
freezing and by frost growth on the frozen surface of the droplets.  

>Freezing temperature statistics. - Whereas the photographic method
used in this investigation permitted a gross statistical evaluation of
the relation between droplet size and freezing temperature, a detailed
study of the dependence of freezing temperature on droplet size by this
method was impractical for two reasons:  
> (1) The relatively small volume of field of view of the camera provided only a small number of droplets 
in sharp focus per 8- by 10-inch negative.  
> (2) Inasmuch as each
droplet was not observed throughout its entire cooling period, small
changes in appearance could not be detected and therefore only those
droplets with a definite nonspherical shape could be considered as
frozen. Since these were often only a small fraction of the total number 
of droplets present, it was likely that a sizeable portion of the
droplets with a spherical shape may have been frozen.  
> 
> In spite of
these limitations several general conclusions can be drawn from the
data presented in tables I and II:  
> (1) At temperatures between 0° and
-20° C, no noncircular droplet images were observed, indicating that
for droplets smaller than 200 microns in diameter the frequency of
occurrence of freezing is very small in this temperature region.
(Frequencies too small to be detected in this investigation may, however, 
be significant in the atmosphere because of the very large number
of droplets present in a cloud.)  
(2) The ratio of the number of non-circular droplet images to the sum of the number of circular plus noncircular 
droplet images was larger at all temperatures for the large
droplet-size group (150 micrometer) than for the small droplet-size group (82 micrometer)
indicating that the droplet freezing temperature tends to increase with
increasing droplet size.  
> (3) The approximate temperature at which
irregular droplet images appeared agrees reasonably well with the
average temperature of the frequency distribution curves for droplets of
corresponding size in reference 3.  
> 
>Thus, the results given in reference 3, for droplets supported on a platinum surface, are at least
approximately the same as for free-falling droplets in air.

## Conclusions  

>CONCLUDING REMARKS  
> 
>The appearance of protuberances and dendritic frost structures on
frozen droplets leads to a hypothesis concerning the transformation of
supercooled clouds to ice crystals and a mechanism for the production
of precipitation. The pointed protuberances which formed at the top of
droplets supported by a metallic surface and froze in a water saturated
environment were observed in a previous experiment to be the locations
of dendritic crystal growth. The tree-like ice structures observed to
grow from such points apparently are so fragile that air currents may
break them off in fragments, which can become nuclei for additional
individual crystalline particles. The pointed protuberances and other
irregularities observed on free-falling droplets may also be the location 
of fragile dendritic frost structures, which in turn may be a
source of small ice-crystal nuclei in the form of splinters or fragments
that break off. Some evidence of dendritic growth on frozen droplets
is apparent in the photographs of free-falling droplets.  
> 
>As an example, consider the case of warm droplets at the base of a
cumulus cloud which are being carried upward by convection currents.
As the air rises and cools, the droplets are eventually supercooled.
If the droplets are carried high enough, the droplet temperatures are
lowered sufficiently for some of the larger droplets to become frozen.
These droplets may then be the source of numerous small ice-crystal
splinters. These ice splinters can then grow rapidly by reverse sublimation 
and in turn break up into additional ice splinters, which cause
further crystallization of the cloud and eventual precipitation.  
> 
>The results obtained with the apparatus described in this report
can only be considered as preliminary because of the serious difficulty
of separating the effects caused by collisions from those inherent in
the freezing process itself. However, the results obtained do yield
significant, if not conclusive, information concerning the shape of droplets 
frozen in air, which in turn throws some light on the nature of
transitions from the liquid to the ice phase in clouds. In addition,
the results obtained inspire more confidence in the extrapolation of
freezing statistics obtained for droplets supported on a platinum surface 
to droplets suspended or falling freely in air in a natural cloud.
