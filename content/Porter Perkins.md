# DRAFT

## Summary  

Porter Perkins published on icing topics for over 50 years while at NACA, NASA, and other groups. 

## Biographies and Memorials  

From 1997:  
>Porter J. Perkins is a senior aerospace engineer working in
aviation safety as manager of airworthiness of research flight
activity at the Lewis Research Center of the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Cleveland,
Ohio, U.S. He has specialized in research on aircraft icing for
more than 25 years. His in-flight measurements to characterize
icing clouds were later incorporated into U.S. icing protection
certification standards. He has authored or co-authored more
than 25 reports in the field of aircraft icing, and continues to
participate in icing research flights. Perkins is an associate
fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

He is named on the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum Wall of Honor ([airandspace.si.edu](https://airandspace.si.edu/support/wall-of-honor/mr-porter-j-perkins-bs-aero)).  

Memorials have named him "The Father of Icing" ([findagrave.com](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/223638554/porter-jewett-perkins)) ([obits.cleveland.com](https://obits.cleveland.com/us/obituaries/cleveland/name/porter-perkins-obituary?id=7948722)).
