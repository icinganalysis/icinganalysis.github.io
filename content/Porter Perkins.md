Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in  
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md) 
in the "Meteorology of Icing Clouds" section. 
While the publications are important and useful, 
they did not directly affect the icing design values adopted in regulations. 
I will review those in their own thread, to be published at a later date.  
Perkins was quite productive during his career at NACA and NASA.
