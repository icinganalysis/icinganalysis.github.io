# DRAFT

## Summary  

Porter Perkins published on icing topics for over 50 years while at NACA, NASA, and other groups. 

## Biographies and Memorials  

>Porter J. Perkins is a senior aerospace engineer working in
aviation safety as manager of airworthiness of research flight
activity at the Lewis Research Center of the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Cleveland,
Ohio, U.S. He has specialized in research on aircraft icing for
more than 25 years. His in-flight measurements to characterize
icing clouds were later incorporated into U.S. icing protection
certification standards. He has authored or co-authored more
than 25 reports in the field of aircraft icing, and continues to
participate in icing research flights. Perkins is an associate
fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

from Protection Against Icing: A Comprehensive Overview, Flight Safety Digest, Vol. 16 No. 6/7/8/9, June-September 1997. [flightsafety.org](https://flightsafety.org/fsd/fsd_jun-sep97.pdf)  

He is included on the Smithsonian Institute Air and Space Museum Wall of Honor ([airandspace.si.edu](https://airandspace.si.edu/support/wall-of-honor/mr-porter-j-perkins-bs-aero)).  

Memorials have named him "The Father of Icing" ([findagrave.com](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/223638554/porter-jewett-perkins)) ([obits.cleveland.com](https://obits.cleveland.com/us/obituaries/cleveland/name/porter-perkins-obituary?id=7948722)).  

As I said in the [Welcome Post]({filename}introduction.md), I once shook hands with Porter Perkins, circa 1993. 
I also saw and heard him at a few meetings. 
That was my only direct link to the NACA era.  

## Publications  

I could find only 22 publications, not the "more than 25" mentioned in the biography above. 
Searching is difficult, as his name is in three forms on ntrs.nasa.gov, at least two forms on scholar.google.com, 
and likewise at other sources (such as P. Perkins, P. J. Perkins, Porter J. Perkins, P. J. Jr Perkins, etc.)  

Several publications on instruments have been reviewed previously, and Perkins used, developed, and improved them.  

Other publications are reviewed in the sections below.  

Several of the publications had co-authors. 
In this series on Porter Perkins I will make comments about things assuming that Perkins either wrote them, 
or had an editorial hand in their inclusions. 
This may not be accurate in all cases, but it is difficult to sort out which co-author wrote what.
