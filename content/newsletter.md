### _“The greatest of all our problems is ice.”_  

_"The situation changed in the mid-1920s when the intrepid aviators of the U.S. Air Mail Service attempted to maintain scheduled day-and-night operations between New York and Chicago... As one of their pilots noted at the time about the hazards of the New York-Chicago route, “the greatest of all our problems is ice.”" [^1]_

## Discussion  

I have an email newsletter with the latest posts and other site-related news, 
which you can receive regardless of the weather. 
Another advantage of subscribing to the newsletter is access to the secret* blog drafts that are in-work, 
before the public sees them. There is no cost to subscribe. 

_[* Well, not so secret if one is acquainted with github.]_

Typical publishing sequence:  

- email newsletter, subscribers may view drafts  
- post at [icinganalysis.github.io](https://icinganalysis.github.io) and [icinganalysis.com](https://icinganalysis.com) (mirrored sites) (simultaneous [RSS](https://icinganalysis.com/feeds/all.rss.xml) update)  
- post notice at mastodon [historians.social/@icinganalysis](https://historians.social/@icinganalysis)   
- post notice on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-cook-96204316a/)  

## Sample newsletter content

Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

Latest post: Site Improvements https://icinganalysis.com/site-improvements.html

Interesting finds: 

A commenter on LinkedIn pointed me to Kelley Johnson's 1940 "Wing Loading, Icing and Associated Aspects of Modern Transport Design"
https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.10478. I might add this to the Ice Shapes and Their Effects thread on the blog.

Most popular posts (so far...):

#6: NACA-TN-313, "The Formation of Ice upon Airplanes in Flight" https://icinganalysis.com/naca-tn-313.html
One of the earliest publications I have reviewed, with eye-catching sketches and a great quote.

Upcoming posts:

The reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).
9/29: A Detailed Comparison of Water Drop Impingement Calculations
10/2: Implementation of multicylinder calculations in Python

Upcoming Aircraft Icing Events:

Submissions for papers open October 3, and close December 13, for the AIAA Aviation Forum, July 29 to August 2, 2024, so get typing!
