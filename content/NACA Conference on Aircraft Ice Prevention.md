### REVIEW OF NACA RESEARCH ON THE THERMAL ICE-PREVENTION SYSTEM. By LEWIS A. RODERT, Cleveland, Ohio {: #review }  

> INTRODUCTION  
>
> When an unprotected airplane encounters icing conditions, its
usefulness is reduced because of the detrimental effects of ice on
performance, dependability, and safety. The research of the NACA
on ice prevention has been directed to a very large extent toward
the use of heat.
> 
> A solution to a problem such as that presented by the formation 
of ice can usually be found, but the solution always involves
penalties. In order to judge the relative importance of penalties
and benefits connected with thermal ice prevention, it is necessary 
to understand the severity of the problem when no protection
is provided. One phase of the research has therefore been concerned 
with evaluating the changes in lift and drag of lifting
surfaces, loss of thrust, unbalance of propellers, loss of vision
through windshields, increased structural loads in external fittings 
such as radio, antennas, and structural damage due to ice
being thrown from propellers or shed from one part and striking
another, which occurs when an airplane is flown in icing conditions.  
> 
> The research on the thermal system was concerned first with
discovering heating arrangements for the various vulnerable parts
of the airplane. Through these arrangements heat could be delivered 
to the wings, the windshield, and the propeller. Upon discovery 
of what appeared to be workable constructional arrangements
for heating these parts, the next concern was the quantity and
distribution of the heat required.  
> 
> Inasmuch as the heat required is determined not by the configuration 
of the vulnerable part alone, but also by the nature
of the icing cloud, the research also included a study of meteorological conditions.
> 
> The scope of the research has been to determine the detrimental 
effects of ice, to investigate means for applying heat to
the vulnerable parts, to establish design procedures for calculating 
the heat required, and to determine the cloud characteristics
> which cause the ice.  
> 
> In the conduct of the research, useful data has been obtained
that is applicable to the range of airplane speed, sizes, and
variations in form that exist or are apt to be found in the near
future.  
> 
> Acknowledgment is made to the United Air Lines, Northwest
Airlines, and the Air Materiel Command and the pilots of these
organizations for their contributions in making possible the 
extensive flight operations in natural icing conditions.

>CONCLUSION
The results of NACA research on the thermal ice-prevention
system have shown that all entering surfaces of aircraft intended
for all-weather operation must be protected and that protection
can be provided by the use of heat without significant penalties
to the usefulness of the airplane.

### FLIGHT INVESTIGATION OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS CONDUCIVE TO AIRCRAFT ICING. By WILLIAM LEWIS, Moffett Field, California {: #conducive }  

> The NACA is currently engaged in a fundamental research investigation 
of aircraft-icing Problems. The meteorological phase of this
investigation consists of the development of instruments required
for the evaluation of the critical factors responsible for the formation 
of ice on aircraft, and the actual measurement of these factors
during flight in icing conditions. These measurements furnish data
establishing, for the pertinent meteorological variables, the range
of values commonly encountered in icing conditions. These data are
required as a basis for the definition of the physical characteristics 
of the maximum icing conditions in which ice-prevention equipment 
will be expected to provide adequate protection. As a result
of this investigation, some progress is also being made toward a
solution of some of the problems associated with the forecasting of
icing conditions. This paper is directed chiefly to the problem
of design conditions, the problems of instrumentation and forecasting 
are treated only incidentally. In the conduct of this
project, a Curtiss-Wright C-46 airplane operated by the Ames
Aeronautical Laboratory has been flown in natural icing conditions
during the last three winters and a considerable amount of data have
been collected. Results of the investigation have been presented
in references 1 through 5. During the 1946-17 season, measurements
in icing conditions were also made with two airplanes operated by
the NACA Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory.

> Conclusions  
> 
>The meteorological conditions conducive to aircraft icing
which are considered to be of most interest to the designer of
thermal ice-prevention equipment are summarized in table I. The
two cases are selected of "most probable maximum" and "typical or
normal" icing conditions. The drop-size distribution has not been
specified in the table but may be considered uniform for these
conditions. In addition to the two conditions specified in the
table, however, the designer should give consideration to the
possibility of encountering drop sizes larger than 35 microns,
although with corresponding low liquid-water content.  
> 
> As a general conclusion, it is believed that the meteorological
factors of icing conditions have been sufficiently defined to allow
the design of thermal ice-prevention equipment on a fundamental
wet-air basis

### METHOD FOR NUMERICALLY OF WATER IMPINGEMENT CLOUD. By CARR B. NEEL, JR. and NORMAN R. BERGRUN, California {: #impingement}  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
> As part of a comprehensive research program directed toward
a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of thermal ice prevention 
for airplanes, the NACA has undertaken an investigation of
tha performance of a heated wing or empennage section in specified
icing conditions. One of the first essentials of such an investigation 
is a method for estimating or calculating the area over
which water will strike a wing section, and the distribution of
water impingement over that area.  
> 
> Previous investigations of this nature have considered the
water-drop trajectories about cylinders (references 1 and 2) and
about an airfoil (reference 2). In these studies, the assumption
was made that the water drops were sufficiently small to obey
Stokes' law of resistance. A more recent investigation on trajectories 
about cylinders, by Langmuir and Blodgett (reference 3),
shows that, for velocities of airplanes and the drop sizes frequently 
present in clouds, Stokes' law no longer applies and the
force acting on the drop can be determined only from a knowledge
of the drag coefficient for spheres. Methods of previous investigators 
were therefore modified to include more accurate values of
the drop drag coefficient, and differential equations were established 
for determining drop trajectories around cylinders, spheres,
and ribbons. These equations were placed into forms suitable for
use in a differential analyzer and, by utilizing an analyzer, the
trajectories were calculated and plotted.
> 
> The designer of a heated wing, desiring to know the rate and
area of water impingement on the leading edge in a specified icing
cloud at a given flight speed, might assume that the impingement
will be the same as that for a cylinder with radius equal to the
wing leading-edge radius. However, there is some question as to
the accuracy of this assumption for large drop diameters and for
wing sections with small leading-edge radii. The designer is
therefore confronted with the desirability of employing a computation
method, preferably without the necessity of a differential analyzer,
which will provide some indication of the area and distribution of
water impingement on airfoil sections. With this view in mind, the
water-drop trajectory equations developed by Langmuir and Blodgett
(reference 3) to include the effect of the variable drag coefficient
for spheres have been modified to establish a step-by-step integration 
method applicable to any two-dimensional flow for which the
streamline velocity components are known. 
> 
> The step-by-step integration method permits the calculation of
any desired number of water-drop trajectories; although if trajectories 
for a large range of airspeeds and drop diameters are required,
the computation time is large and the desirability of access to a
differential analyzer becomes evident. The method also provides a
means for estimating the error that will be incurred by replacing
the airfoil by a cylinder with a radius equal to the leading-edge
radius of the airfoil; and in additional water-impingement data over
the entire airfoil surface can be obtained by the integration method.

>SUMMARY  
> 
> A major difficulty in the solution of a trajectory problem
in both two-and three-dimensional flow is one of obtaining accurate
values of velocity components for streamlines about the body to
be investigated. For two-dimensional flow, the analytic determination 
of the velocity components can be obtained readily for only
a few airfoil sections; and for three-dimensional flow, the analytical 
problem is formidable. Therefore, in order to carry on
extensive trajectory computations for families of airfoils and
various windshield configurations, considerable research remains
in establishing means for experimentally determining air-velocity
components. It is believed, however, that the trajectory method
that has been presented has merit in the fact that it provides a
means for obtaining an indication of the rate and area of water
impingement without resorting to a differential analyzer. In
addition, the method exceeds the scope of previously available
procedures by providing an indication of the distribution of water
interception over the area of impingement.  
> 
> (Editor's note: A complete discussion of the numerical method for
calculating trajectories will be found in reference 4.)

### CALCULATION OF HEAT REQUIRED FOR WING THERMAL ICE PREVENTION IN SPECIFIED ICING CONDITIONS. By CARR B. NEEL, JR. and NORMAN R. BERGRUN, Moffett Field, California {: #wing }  

>INTRODUCTION
> 
> The efficient design of wing thermal ice-prevention equipment
has been hampered greatly by lack of knowledge of the physical
characteristics of the icing conditions upon which to base the
design and the exact process by which water intercepted by a
heated wing is dispersed.  
> 
> The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at present is
engaged in an investigation of the meteorological factors conducive
to icing and a fundamental study of the heat-transfer :processes
which govern the operation of wing thermal ice-prevention equipment.
During the winters of 1945-46 and 1946-47 a Curtiss-Wright C-46
airplane which had been provided with a thermal ice-prevention system
(reference 1) was equipped with special meteorological and electrically 
heated test apparatus and flown in natural icing conditions
along airline routes over most of the United States. The meteorological 
data recorded during the icing conditions encountered in the
two seasons are presented and discussed in references 2 and 3.
The material of this paper was taken from reference 4, and
presents an analysis of tbe data obtained during the 1945-46 and
1946-47 winter seasons with two electrically heated test airfoils.
The data were analyzed usine heat-transfer equations developed by
Hardy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, England
(references 5 and 6). A discussion of the area and rate of water
impingement on one of the airfoil sections based. on an analytical
study of water-drop trajectories (reference 7) is also presented.  

> ...
> 
> From the foregoing discussion, it appears that the extent of
knowledge of the meteorology of icing, the impingement of water
drops on airfoil surfaces, and the processes of heat transfer and
evaporation from a wetted airfoil surface bas been increased to a
point where the design of heated wings on a fundamental, wet-air
basis now can be undertaken with reasonable certainty.

### TENSION IN RADIO ANTENNA WIRES RESULTING FROM ICE FORMATION. By WILLIAM L. KEPPLE, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #antennas }  

>INTRODUCTION  
> 
> Tbe collection of ice on aircraft radio antennas necessitates
an investigation to determine (1) the effect of ice formations on
the electrical properties of the antenna, (2) the effect of ice
formations on the tension occurring in the antenna, and (3) the
decrease in aircraft performance due to antenna ice formations.
Information is also needed concerning tbe prevention and removal
of ice on radio antennas and tbo installation of the radio antennas
in the wings or fuselage.  
> 
> A flight investigation was conducted at tbe NACA Cleveland
laboratory during tho winter of 1946-47 to determine tbe tension
occurring in aircraft antennas while flying in natural icing
conditions. This investigation was conducted at true airspeeds
from 155 to 215 miles per hour and at altitudes at which icing
conditions occurred. The effect of the following factors upon
antenna tension were investigated : (1) distance flown in the
icing region; (2) included angle between the antenna and tbe
thrust axis of the airplane; (3) antenna length; and (4) meteorological 
variables pertinent to ice accretion.

> ...
> 
> Insufficient data were obtained during the investigation to
establish a correlation between antenna tension and the meteorological
variables.
The meteorological
only moderate intensity
recorded while in these
could be encountered in
conditions encountered produced icing of
and consequently tho antenna tension
icing regions would not be as great as
high-intensity icing regions.

### ANALYTIC STUDY OF THERMAL ICE-PREVENTION SYSTEMS APPLIED TO LIGHT AIRCRAFT. By JAMES G. THOMPSON, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #thermal }  

> INTRODUCTION
> 
> The thermal ice-prevention system has been adopted for use
on commercial transports and large military aircraft and consideration 
> is now given to its practicability on smaller aircraft having
a smaller useful load and greater need for economy and simplicity
than the larger aircraft. Conveniences and equipment that have
long been in use on larger aircraft are today being incorporated
in small privately operated aircraft which heretofore were without
such advantages. It is therefore anticipated that a serious effort
will be made to provide ice protection for small aircraft in the
future.  
> 
> An analytical study was made to determine the thermal requirements 
of ice-prevention systems for application on three small aircraft 
with dimensions and specifications covering the range of
sizes commonly found in private operation as follows: wing areas
of 140, 184, and 250 square feet; sea-level horsepower ratings of
75, 185, and 450 brake horsepower; and cruising speeds of 105, 150,
and 205 miles per hour, respectively.  
> 
> The quantity of heat required for ice prevention on small aircraft 
has been determined in order that operators may evaluate the
penalties in weight, cost, and complications, which must be compensated 
by the advantages derived from the application of a thermal ice-prevention system.
Future industrial progress and research will probably reduce these penalties.  

> ...
> 
> A thermal ice-prevention system designed by wet-air method
and values of important parameters assumed in this text will
probably provide protection in the most adverse conditions that
may be encountered in flight; however, it may not be practical to
give all types of airplane this maximum protection. Therefore,
with the proper selection of the meteorological variables and the
degree of protection desired, which are dictated by the airplane's
operating schedule, the total amount of heat required can be
significantly reduced. By intermittently heating the components,
that is, cycling, the amount of heat that must be supplied at any
time can be greatly reduced, thus reducing the large quantities
of heat required for protecting all of the components simultaneously.
By limiting the operations to conditions of lesser severity
than those for which larger scheduled aircraft must be designed and
by taking advantage of savings that may accrue from intermittently
heating the various components, it appears that the thermal ice-prevention 
system may find practical application on small non-scheduled aircraft.

### CALCULATION OF HEAT REQUIRED FOR WINDSHIELD THERMAL ICE PREVENTION IN SPECIFIED ICING CONDITIONS. By GEORGE H. HOLDAWAY, Moffett Field, California  {: #calculation }  

>INTRODUCTION  
One part of a broad icing research program conducted by the
NACA has been concerned with the investigation of thermal means of
windshield ice prevention. The first satisfactory windshield heating 
system investigated was the double-panel heated-air type of
system tested on a Lockheed 12-A airplane, and described by Rodert
and others in reference 1.
> 
> The tests of reference 1 resulted in
the tentative specification of a heat-flow requirement of 1000 Btu
per hour per square foot through the windshield outer surface,
This value was based on data obtained for a flat-pane, V-type windshield 
at flight speeds up to 150 miles per hour, and applied to
internally heated windshields.  
> 
> Although this initial research provided some information on
windshield heat requirements, the results wore empirical in
nature and could not serve as a fundamental basis for the prediction 
of the internal heating requirements for windshield configurations 
and flight conditions different than those investigated.
Accordingly, a fundamental investigation was undertaken to establish 
equations for calculating the heat dissipation from the surface 
of an internally heated windshield in conditions of icing. By
measuring the heat flow from various test windshield surfaces during 
measured icing conditions and comparing these flows with calculated 
values, the validity of proposed design equations was
investigated and design procedures suitable for the prediction of
general windshield heating requirements were established.  
> 
> In addition to the research directed towards the establishment
of the heat requirement in the case where the heating was supplied
internally, a secondary investigation conducted at the same time
was concerned with the practicability of ice prevention by the
means of discharging a jet of heated air into the windshield boundary 
layer. This device was initially installed in the C-46 airplane 
(reference 2) as a means of augmenting the internal, double-panel 
windshield system. The test results with this initial
installation were sufficiently promising to warrant further
investigation.
> 
> The windshield flight investigations conducted by the NACA
Ames Aeronautical Laboratory at Moffett Field, California, during the
winters of 1945-46 and 1946-47 were made in clear air and in
natural icing conditions with a twin-engine, C-46 cargo airplane,
(See fig. 1.) A detailed report of the windshield data obtained
its analysis, and a method for calculating the heat required for
windshield thermal ice prevention are presented in reference 3.  
> 
> Additional windshields were tested on a four-engine, B-24 bomber-type 
airplane operated by the NACA Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory at 
Cleveland, Ohio, during the winter of 1946-47, (See fig. 2.)
The detailed results of this latter investigation are presented in
reference 4 by Kleinknecht.  

>CONCLUSIONS  
> 
> The following conclusions are based on the analytical studies
and test data of this research and should be applicable to windshield 
configurations and icing conditions similar to those
investigated:  
>1. The coefficient of convective heat transfer for the
external surface of flat-plate; V-type, or flush windshield.s can
be approximated with an accuracy suitable for design purposes by
the use of the established equations for turbulent flow on a flat
plate.  
>2. The heat requirement for ice prevention on a flush or
flat-plate airplane windshield during flight in specified icing
conditions can be calculated to an accuracy of 20 percent.  
>3. The complete and continuous prevention of ice accretions
on the surface of a flat-plate or V-type airplane windshield, for
flight in moderate cumulus icing conditions at speeds up to
300 miles per hour, will require a heat flow from the surface of
from 2000 to 2500 Btu per hour per square foot of surface. In
the case of continuous flight for the same speed range, in moderate 
stratus conditions, a heat flow of 1000 Btu per hour per
square foot should prove adequate.  
>4. The complete and continuous prevention of ice accretions
on the surface of a flush-type airplane windshield located well
aft of the fuselage stagnation region, for a speed range up to
300 miles per hour in stratus and moderate cumulus conditions,
can be obtained with a heat flow of 1000 Btu per hour per suuare
foot of surface.  
>5. The tendency of ice to accrete on windshields that are
installed flush with the fuselage contours is considerably less
than for V-type windshields.  
>6. The external-discharge system of windshield thermal ice
prevention is thermally inefficient and requires a heat supply
ap:proximately 20 times that required for an internal system having
the same performance.  
>7 . Windshield installations that conform to the fuselage contours 
are more adaptable to the use of the external-discharge system 
than V-type installations, because the heated jet will flow
naturally over the windshield surface.

### SUMMARY OF INDUCTION-SYSTEM ICE-PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS FOR RECIPROCATING-ENGINE POWER PLANTS. By WILLSON R. HUNTER, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #induction }  

> The purpose of this paper is to summarize NACA research in the
field of induction-system icing and to review recommendations that
should result in inherently ice-free induction systems.
> 
> The formation of ice in engine air-intake systems has been a
recognized hazard since 1921 when ice was rated as a predominant
cause of power failure resulting in airplane crashes. Induction system 
icing has remained a serious hazard despite the development
of relatively ice-free carburetors and despite rigid civil and military 
regulations requiring alternate or heated-air intakes and
alcohol sprays for emergency de-icing. The Civil Aeronautics
Administration report of 195 accidents in 1945 involving personal
aircraft clearly emphasizes the need for aggressive action in the
elimination of this hazard. In 1940, as operations through inclement 
weather began to increase, the Air Transport Association recognized 
the need for a better understanding of the causes, effects,
and prevention of induction-system icing and requested the NACA to
study the problem.
> 
> Research was started in 1941 under the direction of a special
NACA subcommittee in the Altitude Engine Testing laboratory of the
National Bureau of Standards. In 1943 the work was transferred to
newly completed research facilities at the NACA Cleveland laboratory
with a more comprehensive program under Army sponsorship. The NACA
research program included laboratory determination of icing 
characteristics and de-icing requirements for representative 
carburetor-supercharger combinations, dynamometer measurements of the effects
of ice on engine operation, icing-research-tunnel studies of several
Protected air-intake scoops, altitude air-box experiments with
alcohol de-icing systems, and flight research under natural and
simulated icing conditions, The detection of ice by means of
special ice-warning instruments was investigated and a study was
made of methods for eliminating the icing problem by suitable design
of the air entrance, the throttles, and the fuel-injection device.
> 
> Research is now in progress to determine the icing characteristics
of light-airplane induction systems in order to determine the criterions
for an inherently ice-free system.
> 
> Appreciation is extended to the participating airlines, manufacturers, 
and government agencies for the excellent cooperation and
material support throughout this research program.

> ...
> 
> CONCLUSIONS  
> 
> In summarizing the results of NACA research, the following
generalizations can be stated with respect to the icing characteristics 
of existing systems, the remedial action required to protect
these systems, cautions to be observed, and desirable fundamental
improvements that can be made in new designs and perhaps retroactively.  
>1. The icing characteristics of conventional carburetors of both
the suction and pressure type which fuel injected near the throttles
present a serious icing hazard in clear air at inlet-air temperatures
as high as 70° F.  
>2. Fuel-air ratio and mixture distribution ere adversely affected
by icing and by the trapping of water in the air-metering passages of
the carburetor and can cause rough running and engine stoppage.  
>3. Throttles may freeze at a given power setting or when an
automatic pressure regulator compensates for the effects of icing and
may lead to forced landings with no control over power setting.  
>4. Hot-air valves may also freeze in the full-cold or full-hot
position.  
>5. Throttles and hot-air selector valves should be of sturdy
design and with low control forces to permit mechanically breaking
them free when frozen with ice.  
>6. Duct inlet, carburetor and engine configuration, water injection, 
power setting, and fuel volatility significantly affected the
icing characteristics, but engine size, fuel temperature, fuel-air
ratio, and water-alcohol injection did not.   
>7. Screens and air filters in tne main air duct without bypass
constitute an unwarranted icing hazard and should be removed where
possible.  
>8. Exposed fuel nozzles in severe-icing regions may cause leaning
out in some pressure carburetors and excessive enrichment in suction
carburetors.  
>9. Remedial ice protection may be provided by means of selecting
an alternate air intake by warming the surfaces by applying hot air
or alcohol, and by changing the power settings; however, none of these
methods fully removes ice formations that occur upstream of the point
of protection.  
>10. A wet-bulb temperature of 60° F affords prompt de-icing of
serious-ice formation below the carburetor but may cause icing if
applied in dry snow or sleet conditions, and may dislodge sheets of
ice that will fall onto the carburetor and disturb operation. Hot-air 
should be applied when icing begins.  
>11. Excessive temperatures should be avoided in the hot-air
de-icing system to avoid detonation, overcompensation of the fuel-air 
mixture, and excessive loss of power.  
>13. The speed-density metering system with oil-heated throttle
assembly automatically eliminates throttling icing and. water fouling
of the metering system.  
>14. Spinner fuel injection, manifold injection, or cylinder
injection have satisfactorily eliminated fuel-evaporation icing.  
>15. Inherent ice elimination from the entire induction system
may be provided by excluding water from the system, by locating well-designed 
throttles in warm locations, by making the induction system
aerodynamically clean, by injecting fuel where the metal temperatures
will remain above freezing, and by adopting a fuel-metering system
that does not rely on exposed air-metering passages in potential
icing regions.  
>
> It may therefore safely be concluded that a suitable combination 
of known induction-system components can now achieve the goal
of an efficient and ice-free induction system for all-weather aircraft 
that will not require pilot control of heating nor need
alcohol for emergency de-icing.

### HOT-GAS BLEEDBACK FOR JET-ENGINE ICE PROTECTION. By WILLIAM A. FLEMING, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #hot-gas }  

>Ice formation on the inlet of a turbojet engine in flight will
result in a reduction in thrust and, if icing becomes serious, will
render the engine inoperative as a result of high tail-pipe temperatures. 
Such conditions, particularly with axial-flow compressor
engines, make light in icing weather extremely hazardous without
some type of equipment to protect the inlet of the engine from icing.
> 
> As part of a general program now being conducted st the Flight
Propulsion Research Laboratory on ice prevention at the inlet of
turbojet engines, an investigation has been conducted in the altitude
wind tunnel on a 24C engine to study one phase of the ice-prevention
work, The method of ice prevention studied consists of bleeding hot
gas from the turbine inlet and injecting it into the air stream
ahead of the compressor inlet in order to heat the air above the
freezing temperature. This investigation was conducted at altitudes
of 5000 and 20,000 feet with ambient-air temperatures from 0° to 35° F
and over a range of engine speeds.
> 
> The turbine inlet was chosen as the station from which to bleed
the gas, because at this station in the engine the gas is at the
highest temperature and pressure. Because the temperature of the
gas is high, a smaller amount is needed to heat the inlet air above
the freezing temperature than would be required if the gas were bled
from some other station in the engine. Inasmuch as the pressure at
this station is also high, bleeding from the turbine inlet makes it
possible to discharge the gas into tho air stream at sonic velocity,
thus affording better penetration of the hot air into the cold air.

>... 
> 
> CONCLUSIONS  
> 
> Ice forms rapidly at the compressor inlet under sevLre icing
conditions and is extremely dangerous, inasmuch as the engine may
be rendered inoperative within 1 or 2 minutes after icing begins.
The hot-gas bleedback system should be used to prevent ice formation 
at the engine inlet. With configuration 1 or 2, 15 to 30 minutes
were required to de-ice the engine inlet with the water spray
turned off and once ice had formed, the system was not adequate
to de-ice the inlet with the water spray remaining on. With
4 percent of the gas being bled to the engine inlet, the net
thrust was reduced 18.8 percent at an engine speed of 12,000 rpm.
Raising the inlet air temperature accounts for approximately 
three-fourths of this decrease in thrust. At similar operating
conditions, the specific fuel consumption based on net thrust was
increased 16-1/2 percent.

### PROTECTION OF JET-ENGINE INLETS BY MEANS OF INERTIA SEPARATION OF FREE-WATER PARTICLES. By UWE H. VON GLAHN, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #protection }  


>In endeavoring to protect turbojet engines from impact icing,
it would appear that the following methods may provide the solution
of the icing problem:  
> 1. Bleedback of hot gases from some point in the engine and
injecting the gases into the alr stream ahead of the compressor
inlet, thue raising the air and water-droplet temperatures
above 32° F.  
> 2. Heating all the surfaces subject to icing above 32° F.  
> 3. Water-inertia separation from the air stream inside the
nacelle by suitable inlet design.  
> 4. External water exclusion by suitable inlet design.  
>
> After a study of the four methods which might be utilized to
reduce the icing hazard to a minimum, the conclusion is that no one
system can be applied to all aircraft. The methods presented can
be applied only at the expense of aerodynamic performance, air frame
weight, compressor design, or cabin pressurization.  
> 
> This paper presents methods 3 and 4 for the ice protection of
turbojet engines.  
> 
> The design criterions for the turbojet engine inlet must include
the following:  
> 1. The rate of free-water ingestion must be reduced to a
minimum,  
> 2. Ram-pressure recovery must be maintained as high as possible
in order not to reduce the engine performance.  
> 3. The Inlet shall be automatic in its operation throughout an
icing condition.  
>
> With these conditions in mind, aerodynamic and preliminary
icing tests were conducted in the NACA Cleveland icing research
tunnel on experimental nonicing inlets for use with axial-flow
turbojet engines.

> ... 
> 
> CONCLUSIONS  
> 
> The results of the investigation of several types of nonicing
inlet designs can be summarized as follows:  
> 1. An internal water-inertia separation inlet composed of two
concentric ducts can be designed to prevent the entry of most of
the free droplets into the outer annular duct. The degree of water
separation depends on the ram-pressure recovery that can be tolerated
in an icing condition; the better the droplet separation characteristics, 
the lower the ram-pressure recovery. For normal flight
operation, ram-pressure recovery values comparable to those obtained
with direct-ram inlets can be obtained. The nacelle-nose inlet,
duct-splitter ring leading edge, and alternate-duct elbow surfaces
must be heated locally.  
> 2. The single-duct inertia-separation inlets did not show
improved performance characteristics over those of the two duct
system for an icing condition and also had a low ram recovery for
all flight conditions.  
> 3. The annular submerged-nose inlets investigated excluded some
of the droplets but were still subject to considerable screen icing.
These inlets also exhibited undesirable aerodynamic characteristics.

### ENGINE COOLING FAN AND PROPELLER SPINNER DE-ICING. By E. E. CALLAGHAN, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #engine }  

>In certain installations of high-powered redial engines in
airplanes of large gross weights the problem of engine cooling is
very difficult.  
> 
> The use of an engine cooling fan, in either the submerged or
nacelle type installation, has become the customary means of providing 
the additional cooling air that is necessary. Any blockage
of the fan that would reduce the amount of cooling air must, of
course, be prevented and anti-icing or de-icing of the fan is a
problem of fundamental importance. Because of this expected loss
in cooling air flow due to icing of the fan blades, an investigation
of a typical cooling-fan installation was conducted in the icing
research tunnel of the NACA Cleveland laboratory to determine the
icing characteristics of the fan assembly components, to evaluate
the effect of icing on fan performance, and to investigate the
effectiveness of several systems of ice protection (reference 1).

>CONCLUSIONS  
The results of an icing investigation of a conventional radial-engine 
cooling-fan installation in the icing research tunnel indicate
that:  
> 1. The icing of the unprotected installation presents a serious
operational problem, Reduction in air flow below the minimum value
required for adequate engine cooling occurred within 2 minutes and
complete stoppage of the cooling air flow through the fan assembly
occurred within 5 minutes under normal icing conditions.  
> 2. Alcohol de-icing of the fan proved to be ineffective and in
some cases increased the icing problem by causing large ice formations
on the stator vanes.  
> 3. Electrical heat de-icing was the most promising method of
de-icing the blades. The fan blades required a minimum power density
of 6 watts per square inch but for the stator vanes this power density
proved insufficient.  
> 4. The spinner results show that good agreement between the
analytical and experimental results are obtainable under known icing
conditions.

### EFFECT OF ICE FORMATIONS ON AIRPLANE PERFORMANCE. By G. MERRITT PRESTON and. W. V. GOUGH, JR., Cleveland, Ohio  {: #effect }  

>A flight investigation has been conducted in natural icing
conditions by the NACA to determine the effect of ice formations
on airplane performance.  
> 
> The lack of quantitative evidence of the serious effect of
ice formations on the aerodynamic performance of the propellers has
tended to retard the adoption of new and improved systems of propeller
ice protection. Numerous pilots have reported serious reduction in
airplane performance attributed to inadequate propeller protection.
The evidence was inconclusive inasmuch as the effect of ice on the
remainder of the airplane and the accuracy of airspeed indication
could not be evaluated.
> 
> Wind-tunnel tests employing simulated ice formations (reference 1)
gave results that indicated a loss in propeller efficiency of 3 percent
for level flight. Propeller-whirl tests, during which icing conditions
were artificially created, indicated negligible losses (reference 2).
Preliminary flight tests (reference 3) indicate a significant loss in
performance of the propellers.
> 
> The results reported in references 1 and 2 are inconclusive
inasmuch as the quantities of ice simulated or obtained are smaller
than formations frequently observed during flight in natural icing
conditions.
> 
> The results reported in reference 3 are also inconclusive inasmuch
as they do not permit distinction between the effects of propeller ice
and the effects of other ice formations on the performance of the
airplane.
> 
> Formations of ice on propellers, in addition to deleteriously
affecting the propeller performance, has been observed to cause
serious unbalance. Also, the natural shedding of ice from the
propeller commonly results in fuselage damage and passenger discomfort.
> 
> The present investigation was undertaken to determine the effect
of ice formation on unprotected propellers by operating in natural
icing conditions; by measuring the effects of the ice on the propellers
independently of the effects of ice on other parts of the airplane;
and, conversely, to measure the effects of ice on other components
independently of the effect of ice formations on the propellers. The
degree of propeller unbalance that was experienced during flight with
ice accretions on the blades was evaluated in the investigation,
Photographs were taken in flight of natural ice formations on the airs
plane components to permit simulation for aerodynamic studies in
wind tunnels.

> ...
> 
> Those data are interpreted in torms of parasite drag by the
method given in reference 4. Figure 15 shows the percent drag increase
based on tho drag of the ice-free airplane. Ice on the inboard-wing
panels accounted for an 8-percent drag increase; tail surfaces,
11-percent drag increase; and, tho outboard-wing panels, 27-percent
drag increase, ice on the engine cowlings added 10 percent and the
miscellaneous components, the second largest offender, were responsible
for 25 percent of tho airplane-drag increase.
> 
> This investigation did not include tho determination of such
factors as stalling speed, minimum single-engine speed, and low-speed
flying qualities. It ie significant to report that the control response
of the airplane approached the point of being marginal when the entire
airplane, except tho propellers, was iced.
> 
> The data and results presented here are directly applicable only
to the airplane type used in this investigation nnd under meteorologically 
similar conditions. However, by proper consideration of such
factors as leading-edge radius, loading-edge lengths, and surface
areas, the drag data can be used for estimating the effect of ice on
tho performance of other airplanes.

### PROPELLER ICE PROTECTION BY MEANS OF HOT GASES IN HOLLOW BLADES. By VERNON H. GRAY, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #propeller }  

>Gas-heated hollow propellers have recently been investigated
both analytically end experimentally (references 1 to 5) to determine 
the ice-prevention effectiveness of this method of blade heating.
A typical schematic flow diagram for a gas-heated propeller is shown
in figure 1.
> 
> The gas is first heated in a suitable heat source and passes
through a manifold and a collector ring to cuffs located on the
blade shanks. The gas then flows radially outward through the hollow 
blade, which may have internal partitions to confine the flow to
the forward portion of the blade, as shown in the cross section
(fig. 1). The gas leaves the blade through a discharge nozzle at
the blade tip.
> 
> The analytical investigation developed a method for determining
the required initial gas temperature and flow rate for maintaining
surface temperatures on all parts of the heated blade area of at
least 32° F. Two previous theoretical investigations upon which
parts of this analysis are based are reported in references 6 and 7.
> 
> The experimental investigation obtained surface temperatures
and icing data for three types of propeller blade subjected to icing
conditions in the icing research tunnel, Three types of blade investigated 
were (1) hollow unpartitioned blades; (2) blades with radial
partitions located at 50 percent of chord; and (3) blades with partitions 
at 25 percent of chord, The partitioned blades were investigated 
to determine the extent of heat flow savings.

> ...
> 
> CONCLUSIONS  
> 
> From the experimental investigation described, the following
conclusions are made: Unpartitioned blades similar to those investigated 
will give adequate ice protection with a minimum heat input
of 40,000 Btu per hour per blade; 50 percent partitioned blades with
a heat input of 14,000 Btu per hour provide marginal ice protection,
with an indicated need of 20,000 Btu per hour for adequate ice protection. 
The 25 percent partitioned blades investigated were underheated 
to an extent that no safe value of heat input was indicated
that would with certainly preclude ice formations aft of the heated
area.  
> 
> From the analysis presented, it can be concluded that gas-heated 
propeller blades with carefully designed internal passages
will provide better chordwise and radialwise ice protection than
external blade shoes for comparable heat input values. In addition,
gas-heated blades will not disturb the airfoil contour or be subject 
to damage by erosion.

### ELECTRO-THERMAL METHODS OF PROPELLER ICE PROTECTION. I - CYCLICAL DE-ICING BY EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL BLADE HEATERS. By J. P. LEWIS, Cleveland, Ohio  {: #electro }  

>A number of investigations has been made to obtain a solution
to the problem of the protection of propellers in icing conditions.
> 
> In the past, partial protection has been obtained by the use of
pastes, lacquers, and alcohol in conjunction with blade feed shoes
None of these methods provided adequate and positive protection and,
with the development of thermal de-icing systems for the vest of tho
airplane, attention has centered on the development of a thermal
system for propellers. Two general methods for the thermal protection
of propellers have been proposed; the first system employs electrical
heating of ths blades, and in the second system a hot gas is used 28
described by Gray. This paper discusses the electro-thermal system
and reports the results obtained from an investigation of two types
of electrically heated propellers in tho NACA Cleveland icing research
tunnel.
> 
> The development of an electrical system for propellers began as
early as 1936 (reference 1). Initial investigations and analyses
shoved the practicability and advantages of such a system of ice
protection. Much of the early work was concerned with the details
of the development of practical blade heaters and a power supply
system with much of the experimental data being of a limited and
inconclusive nature (reference 2). A considerable amount of experience 
and data were obtained by flights in natural and simulated icing
conditions at the Ice Research Base, Minneapolis, Minnesota
(reference 3). Investigations were conducted with two types of
external-blade heater, one of wutch consisted of a rubber wire-insert
blade shoe, whereas the second heater consisted of conductive rubber.
From these investigations a minimum power input of 2.5 Watts per
square inch was recommended with the heated arcs extending to
20 percent of chord and 90 percent of the blade radius. Those early
investigations wore primarily concerned with continuous heating of the
blades to obtain lce prevention rather than de-icing, In addition ihe
Lack of suitable instrumentation prevented a definition and correlation
of the icing conditions encountered.
> 
> Following these tests an analytical investigation of the mower
requirements for a thermal-electric system (reference 4) determined
power input for ice prevention of 1700 watts, per blade, which is
equivalent to an average power density of 6 3/4 watts per square inch.
For ice removal a power of 800 watts per blade was required, which is
equivalent to an average pover density of 3.2 watts per square inch.
> 
> The indicated power requirement for continuous heating was in excess
of that available on current aircraft. As a result, attention centered
on the development of a cyclical or intermittent beating system. In
this system the blades ore allowed to ice and heat is then applied for
a limited period to remove the ice deposit, the cycle is then repeated.
In addition to the power economics obtained, cyclical heating was also
presented as a solution to the problem of runback and refreezing.
> 
> Some of the important requirements for a cyclical de-icing system
may be stated as follows: The ice removal must be prompt and complete
with a minimum expenditure of power. The icing allowed during the
heat-off period must not impair the aerodynamic performance of the
propeller. The throw-off of ice during heating must bo such that a
low vibration level is maintained, no damage is suffered by the rest
of the aircraft, and there is a minimum of discomfort to the passengers.
The investigations of electro-thermal methods of propeller ice protection
in the icing research tunnel (references 5 and 6) were primarily
concerned with the determination of the power distribution and cycle
time requirements for cyclical blade heating.

> ...
> 
> CONCLUSIONS
> 
> The results of the investigation of electrical blade heaters
indicate that several important conclusions can be made as to the
requirements for the design and operation of such systems of propeller 
ice protection.
> 
> The maximum heated areas should be at least equal to the maximum
ice-covered area. For the propeller with the external heaters this
maximum are extended a distance of 4 inches on both faces at the shank, 
tapering to approximately 1 inch at the tip. Similar although
slightly greater arcas were indicated for tho internally heated blade.
The minimum heated area depends upon the effect of residual ice formations 
on propeller performance and the allowable tolerance of such
performance losses.
> 
> For cyclical de-icing a power distribution approaching chordwise 
uniformity is indicated, For ice prevention, however, a concentration 
of heat at the leading edge is required. The radial extent
and distribution of heat will depend chiefly upon the propeller
operating conditions. The power density is a function of the ambient-air 
temperature and heating time. For heating times of less than
40 seconds, power densities of 5 to 10 watts por square inch are
required for corresponding ambient temperatures of 25° to 0° F.
> 
> For the external heater, heating times of 12 to 30 seconds,
depending upon power input and temperature are required. A cycle
time four times tho length of the heating period gave the best results
for both heaters. With the internal heater a minimum heating time
of 25 to 30 seconds is required.
> 
> By comparing the two types of heater, it can be seen that each
has certain advantages and disadvantages. Thw external heater can bo
applied to all types of blades, both hollow and solid. Compared with
the internal heater, the external heater has less thermal lag which
results in a quicker ice removal with less danger of runback. The
main disadvantage of the external heater is its susceptibility to
wear and damage from abrasion. Experience has indicated that this
abrasion damage may limit the radial coverage to approximately 65 percent
of the blade radius. An installation with an internal heater suffers
no aerodynamic penalties resulting from an external shoe and in addition
is free from abrasion trouble. With the internal heater care must
be taken in the disposition of the heater elements to obtain tic correct
heat distribution on the external surface, and in this respect it
resembles the gas-heated blade. Compared with the hot-gas system,
electrical de-icing has less thermal lag requiring little warm up
and in general requires a less complicated heat supply system.

### ELECTRO-THERMAL METHODS OF PROPELLER ICE PROTECTION. II - SERVICE EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRICAL BLADE HEATERS IN NACA FLIGHT OPERATIONS. By GERARD J. PESMAN, Cleveland, Ohio {: #electro2 }  

>Information concerning the service performance of electrical
propeller anti-icing systems is not plentiful; accordingly, a review
of the service experience of NACA flight groups with such equipment
during the winter of 1946-1947 is presented. The information was
taken from service records of airplanes used for icing research end
from interviews with service personnel and personnel who actually
participated in the research flights. During these flights the
airplanes were deliberately flown into the worst icing conditions
that could be found.
> 
> The data presented are not the results of research programs and
should therefore be considered as only qualitative indications of
the service to be expected from such equipment in commercial service.

> ...
> 
> SUMMARY OF RESULTS
> 
> A study of the service records and service performance of
electro-thermal anti-icing systems for propellers installed on NACA
icing research airplanes during the winter of 1946-1947 gave the
following qualitative results:  
>1. A heat concentration of 4.8 watts per square inch on the
leading edge and 2.4 on the camber faces of the propeller blades
was insufficient for satisfactory anti-icing at an atmospheric liquid-water 
content of 0.42 gram per cubic meter.  
>2. A heat concentration of 5.25 watts per square inch on the
leading edge and 3.50 watts on the camber faces of the propeller
blades was satisfactory in atmospheric liquid-water content to
0.415 gram per cubic meter.  
>3. Service troubles with the blade shoes included open or short
circuits in the leads, breakage of heating-element wires, and poor
adhesion of the shoes to the propeller blades.  
>4. Possible future trouble with blade shoes may be leading-edge
erosion and eroding of protrusions caused by buckling of resistance
wires leading to exposure of these wires.  
>5. The propeller-hub generators have insufficient capacity to
take care of their present load and have design faults that must be
corrected.
