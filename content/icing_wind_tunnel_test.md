###_"Icing wind tunnels can simulate natural icing with water-spray and refrigeration systems ... to permit safe, convenient and relatively inexpensive testing."_ [^1]  

While there were extensive publications on how to use aerodynamic wind tunnels in the NACA-era 
(for example, Pope's "Wind Tunnel Testing" [^2]), 
there was no reference for using icing wind tunnels that I could find, 
and I cannot think of a current publication that provides comprehensive guidance. 

This thread will not single-handedly correct that problem, 
but it will summarize uses, 
and perhaps provide some guidance by examples. 

As there are numerous NACA publications (40+) that describe specific icing wind tunnel tests,
but only a little about the icing wind tunnel itself in each one, 
I will not have a detailed review of most of the individual publications in this thread. 
Instead, I will use the collective themes below about icing wind tunnels. 

There are significant icing wind tunnel test method improvements in the post-NACA era that will also be covered. 

##NACA-ERA:

NACA-TN-339, "Refrigerated Wind Tunnel Tests on Surface Coatings for Preventing Ice Formation"  

Uses of the NACA Icing Wind Tunnels  

Calibration of the NACA icing wind tunnels

Scaling in NACA tests

##Post NACA-ERA:

Development of Test Similarity  

Bilanin Pi-Terms    

Weber Number Effects  

The Effect of Humidity  

Anti-ice Test Similarity  

Large Drop Icing
