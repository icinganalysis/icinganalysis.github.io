>SUMMARY  
> 
>A Bragg X-ray spectrometer equipped with a volume-sensitive Geiger 
counter and Soller slits and employing filtered molybdenum Kα, radiation 
was used to obtain a set of diffracted intensity curves as a function 
of angle for supercooled water. Diffracted intensity curves in 
the temperature region of 21° to -16° C were obtained. The minimum
between the two main diffraction peaks deepened continuously with 
lowering temperature, indicating a gradual change in the internal 
structure of the water. No discontinuity in this trend was noted at 
the melting point. The internal structure of supercooled water was
concluded to become progressively more ice-like as the temperature 
is lowered.

>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE  
> 
>A Bragg X-ray spectrometer equipped with a Geiger counter and 
Soller slits was employed using filtered molybdenum Kα radiation 
(figs. 1 and 2). A zirconium oxide filter was used at the Geiger tube 
entrance. Each Soller slit system consisted of nine channels 0.017 
inch wide by 0.365 inch high with lead spacers 0.005 inch thick. A
Soller slit 1-3/8 inches long was mounted between the X-ray tube and the
sample and a similar one 22 inches long was mounted between the sample 
and the Geiger counter. The X-ray tube current was held constant by 
an external current controller that automatically adjusted the filament 
current to compensate for any changes in tube current...

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The average diffracted intensity curves, ranging from 21° to -8° C, 
corrected for absorption, polarization, and scattering by the glass 
container, are shown in figure 3. A diffracted intensity curve for a 
single data run at -16° C is indicated in the same figure by a dashed 
line; in addition, the positions and relative intensities of the two 
most intense diffraction peaks for ice (reference 8) are shown. The 
curves at 21° and 4° C were obtained for direct comparison with the
supercooled data and are in good agreement with previously published 
data in this temperature region although the resolution of the two 
prominent peaks is somewhat inferior. This sacrifice in resolving 
power was necessary in order to keep the time required for the supercooled 
data runs to a minimum and thus reduce the probability of 
accidental crystallization of the water sample.

>There are three interesting features of this set of diffracted
intensity curves (fig. 3):  
> (1) The most prominent peak shows a 
small but continuous shift toward smaller scattering angles as the
temperature is lowered. The peak shifts from 13° 15' at 21° C to 
12° 40' at -8° C.
> (2) The second diffraction peak shows no tendency
to shift angular position with temperature but remains at a scattering 
angle of approximately 18° 20' throughout the temperature range investigated.  
>(3) The most striking feature of the set of diffracted intensity 
curves is the gradual deepening of the minimum between the two main 
peaks as the temperature is lowered into the supercooled range; that is, 
the second peak becomes more sharply resolved. This is a continuation 
of the trend found by other investigators at temperatures above the 
melting point and is an indication that the internal structure of the 
water is apparently changing in a gradual and continuous manner as the 
degree of supercooling is increased. No discontinuity in this trend 
occurs at the melting point. Analysis of diffraction curves above the 
melting point by previous investigators (references 11 and 17) indicate 
that the increase in resolution of this second peak as the temperature 
is lowered is due to a more ice-like internal structure of the water 
sample. Therefore, a reasonable conclusion that can be drawn, for the 
temperature range investigated, is that the supercooled water is becoming 
progressively more ice-like in structure as the temperature is 
lowered. This trend is consistent with the density change with temperature 
of supercooled water reported in reference 21 and shown in figure 4. 
The density of water decreases throughout the supercooled range indicated 
in the figure. This decrease could only be explained by a gradual 
change in the internal arrangement of the water molecules toward a
less closely packed structure.

>CALCULATION OF SPONTANEOUS FREEZING TEMPERATURE FROM DIFFRACTION DATA  
Various theories of the mechanism of the initiation of crystallization 
of supercooled water by homogeneous nucleation involve assumptions 
that the internal structure of supercooled water becomes locally more 
ordered, or more ice-like, as the temperature is lowered; that is, 
groups of molecules form ordered aggregates or microcrystals which
can act as freezing nuclei. Whether or not these aggregates can 
initiate crystallization depends on their structure, their effective 
size, and the temperature of the supercooled water. Inasmuch as the 
X-ray diffraction data of this report indicate that the internal 
structure of supercooled water apparently becomes progressively more 
ice-like as the temperature is lowered, qualitative support is lent
to the suggestions appearing in the literature (for example reference 7) 
that the spontaneous freezing temperature can be calculated theoretically 
from the Thomson equation presented in reference 22. The 
temperature Tr, at which an isomorphic particle of equivalent radius
r can initiate freezing, as given by the Thomson relation...
> 
>In ice, each molecule is surrounded by four other molecules at a 
radial distance of 2.76 A [Angstrom, 1^-10 m] with a second set of neighbors at a radial 
distance of 4.51 A. In reference 7, the radius of this second sphere of 
coordination for ice is assumed to be the effective radius of the 
homogeneous nucleus and the spontaneous freezing temperature of supercooled 
cooled water is calculated from the Thomson equation to be:  
>>Tr - TN ~= -41° C
>
>This calculated spontaneous freezing temperature agrees well with the  
experimental results of references 3 and 4.  
In order for the Thomson equation to be valid, the particle 
acting as nucleus must be truly isomorphic because no term that takes 
into account the work of nucleus formation is included. If it is 
assumed that the microcrystals present in supercooled water have a 
lattice structure identical with that of ice at the spontaneous 
freezing temperature, these microcrystals are truly isomorphic nuclei 
and the equation can be applied directly. This calculation therefore 
depends on the assumption that the 4.51 A sphere of coordination found 
in the ice lattice is also present in supercooled water. In reference 17, 
> the radial distribution curves calculated for molecules about 
a given molecule for water at 1.5° C show a marked concentration of 
neighbors at a distance of about 4.5 A. Thus, if ice-like microcrystals 
of about 4.5 A radius were present in supercooled water at 
approximately -41° C, they would initiate crystallization at this 
temperature as no work of nucleus formation would be needed and their  
radius would be of sufficient size to permit growth.
The X-ray diffraction data of this report lend qualitative support 
to the theory of nucleation presented; however, too much reliance cannot 
be placed on a calculation of this type for the following
reasons:  
(1) There is still a question as to whether freezing of water 
droplets or direct sublimation occurs in clouds at temperatures in the 
region from -38° to -42° C  
(2) Heterogeneous nucleation (such as that due to ions from 
dissolved salts, reference 23) maybe active even in this temperature 
region (see reference 5)  
(3) In reference 24 it is reported that water has been supercooled 
to -72° C (although as yet not duplicated by others)  
(4) The liquid-solid interfacial surface energy is not known precisely    
(5) The X-ray diffraction data of this report extend only as low 
as -16° C.  

## Conclusions  

>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
Diffracted intensity curves using filtered molybdenum Kα
radiation representing the average of several runs were obtained in the 
temperature range 21° to -8° C. A diffracted intensity curve for a
single run at -16° C was also obtained. The important features of the 
set of diffracted intensity curves are:  
> (1) the most prominent peak 
shifted from a scattering angle of 13° 15' at 21° C to 12° 40' at
-8° C,  
> (2) the second diffraction peak remained at an approximately fixed 
angle of 18° 20' throughout the temperature range investigated,  
> (3) the 
minimum between the two main peaks deepened continuously as the temperature 
was lowered, resulting in better resolution of the two peaks as
the temperature was lowered.  
> 
>It is concluded that the changes in the diffracted intensity curves 
are an indication of changes in the internal structure of the supercooled 
water, which apparently becomes progressively more ice-like in 
structure as the temperature is lowered.
