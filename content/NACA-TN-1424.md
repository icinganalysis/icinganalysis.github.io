## Summary
The value of the mutlicylinder data for determining drop size distribution is questioned.  

## Key points  
1. Two methods for determining drop size distributions are compared.  
2. The difference in water drop concentration around an aircraft body is proposed as an explanation for results from the two methods.  
3. A temperature effect of icing conditions is noted.  

## Abstract  

>  Meteorological data from flight observations in icing conditions 
during the winter of 1946-47 are presented. Data on liquid
water content, temperature, and mean-effective drop diameter are
shown to be consistent with values previously proposed for maximum
icing conditions. Data on drop-size distribution as obtained by
the rotating-cylinder method, although consistent with measurements
previously made, were found to be inconsistent with data on drop-
size distribution derived from the ratio of the maximum diameter
to the mean-effective diameter when the maximum diameter was
calculated from the area of impingement on a stationary cylinder.
The relation between temperature and maximum liquid water content
in layer clouds is discussed and estimates are given for the
highest values of water content to be expected in layer clouds at
various temperatures.

##Discussion


###Drops size distributions

The drop size distributions definitions and cylinder impingement analysis methods from [^2] are used

A comparison of two methods of determining the drop size distribution yielded rather different results.

###Effect of the aircraft body on drop concentrations

A possible explanation for the differences was the positions of the instruments:

For methods to assess the water drop concentration around a body, see [^3] and [^4].

Even with the differences in drop size distributions, it was noted in the conclusion that:

>   In spite of the inconsistency it is believed that the data on mean-effective diameters are fairly reliable.

###A temperature effect on icing conditions

An effect of temperature was noted.
