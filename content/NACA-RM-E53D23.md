##Summary 
Detailed procedures for the use of multicylinders are described.

##Key points  
1. Detailed procedures for the in-flight use of multicylinders are described.
2. Detailed procedures for analyzing results from of multicylinders are described, with specific examples.

##Abstract

>  The rotating multicylinder method for in-flight determination of
liquid-water content, droplet size, and droplet-size distribution in
icing clouds is described. The theory of operation, the apparatus
required, the technique of obtaining data in flight, and detailed methods 
of calculating the results, including necessary charts and tables,
are presented.

##Discussion

The steps for in-flight measurements are detailed:

> The basic steps involved in the application of the multicylinder
method are essentially as follows:  
>  (1) Exposure of a set of cylinders of different sizes in the super-cooled 
cloud for a measured time at a known pressure-altitude,
true air speed, and ambient temperature  
>  (2) Disassembly of the cylinders and storage of the ice-covered
cylinders in separate water-proof containers  
>  (3) Weighing of the individual cylinders plus containers in both
the wet and dry condition to obtain the net weight of collected
ice  
>  (4) Determination of liquid-water content, droplet size, and
droplet-size distribution by comparing the measured weight of
ice collected on eacn cylinder with theoretical computations
for comparable cylinders and comparable flight and atmospheric conditions   

> These basic steps are discussed in detail in subsequent sections.

The impingement tables from the recently published [NACA-TN-2904]({filename}NACA-TN-2904.md) [^2] 
were used in the analysis of the measured cylinder data. 

The data in Tables I and IV provide an actual measured flight data case. 
This case is different from some of the other examples that we have seen, 
as the final outer diameter of the iced cylinder was not measured, 
but was calculated from an assumed ice density (850 kg/m^3).

The same cylinder data were processed in two different ways, yielding slightly different results (Tables I and IV).

Table IV final result: MVD=14.1 micrometer, LWC=0.30 g/m^3, Langmuir E distribution.  

##Conclusions

The limitations of the multicylinder method are summarized in the Conculsions:

> The rotating multicylinder method for determining cloud-droplet
size and liquid-water content has several inherent disadvantages; however, 
it is considered to be the most reliable technique known at this
time that is adaptable to flight use. The meteorological data obtained
with the multicylinder method are the only data available for the design
of ice-protection equipment for aircraft. An important disadvantage of
the method lies in its insensitivity in discriminating among different
droplet-size distributions. An evaluation of the sensitivity is presented 
in reference 3. Another disadvantage is that the droplet-size
distribution obtained by the multicylinder method is not necessarily
the actual droplet-size distribution existing in the cloud but rather
an assumed droplet-size distribution (table III). Although the actual
droplet-size distribution in the cloud may affect the amount of ice
collected on the cylinders in the manner described by the theoretical
computations for an assumed droplet-size distribution, the area of
coverage on an airfoil, or on other nonrotating members, in the cloud
may differ from the area theoretically computed on the basis of the
assumed distribution indicated by the rotating multicylinder method.
The reason for the difference in area, or extent of coverage, is that
the size of the largest droplets in the assumed distribution (given as
a ratio to the volume median) is an arbitrarily assumed-value, and the
multicylinder method does not provide a means for obtaining this value
from the cloud data.
