##Summary 
Detailed procedures for the use of multicylinders are described.

##Key points  
1. Detailed procedures for the in-flight use of multicylinders are described.
2. Detailed procedures for analyzing results from of multicylinders are described, with specific examples.

##Abstract

>  The rotating multicylinder method for in-flight determination of
liquid-water content, droplet size, and droplet-size distribution in
icing clouds is described. The theory of operation, the apparatus
required, the technique of obtaining data in flight, and detailed methods 
of calculating the results, including necessary charts and tables,
are presented.
