>"For full-scale considerations, the alternate-duct
area must therefore be increased to an extent that it would pass
sufficient air to the engine at a reasonable Mach number and pressure loss. 
This design requirement could be attained with configuration E by 
increasing the inlet gap about 26 percent and then
scaling the entire configuration to fit the engine." NACA-RM-E50E03
