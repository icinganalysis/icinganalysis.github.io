> ###"Upon comparing this chart with Langmuir's tables (reference 7), it was found that his selections of the representative radii for the various sub-divisions of the volume were in error." [^1]

##Summary  
The Langmuir drop size distribution are almost normal distributions.

##Key points
1. The Langmuir drop size distribution are almost normal distributions.  
2. Perhaps it was originally intended that they be exactly normal distributions.

##Discussion

###Normal drop size distributions

[Normal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) show up many places in nature, 
so it is not surprising that drop sizes in clouds can approximate a normal distribution.  



> The matter was not pursued further at the time, but as a part of the present study it was decided to
investigate the effect this error might have on the collection-efficiency
graphs, based on Langmuir's data, that have been used by virtually all
workers with the multicylinder method.
