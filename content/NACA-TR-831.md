##Abstract 

> A method is given for calculating the temperature that a
surface, heated internally by air, will assume in specified 
conditions of icing. The method can be applied generally to 
predict the performance, under conditions of icing, of the thermal
system for protecting aircraft. Calculations have been made
for a section of the wing of the C-46 airplane, and the results
agree closely with the temperatures measured. The limit of
protection, when the temperature of the surface reaches 32°F,
has been predicted for the leading edge. The temperature of
the surface in conditions of icing with air at 0°F also has been
calculated. The effect of kinetic heating and the effect of the
concentration of free water and size of droplet in the cloud are
demonstrated.

##Discussion 

The nomenclature may be challenging, so peruse the symbols used: 
![Symbols](images/NACA-TR-831/Symbols.png) 

The ice protection heat exchanger is described in detail in NACA-ARR-5A03b. 
Hot air from an internal "D" chamber enters a corrugated heat exchanger near the leading edge.

The thermal performance calculations are detailed. 
Large portions are reproduced herein:

> THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
CLEAR AIR  
In clear air, the equation which gives the balance of the
flow of heat to and from the surface is  
> ![Equation 1](images/NACA-TR-831/Equation1.png)  
> The equation which gives the change in temperature of the
hot air t_a, as it flows over the inner surface is  
> ![Equation 2](images/NACA-TR-831/Equation2.png)  
> Values of t_s and t_a, which satisfy both equations, are found
by trial. These are the mean values for a strip of width Δs in
a chordwise direction and unit length spanwise. Equation
(2) is inexact, since the air flowing through the space between
inner and outer skins receives heat through the back of the
corrugations from the air as it flows from the main duct to
the entry to the corrugations. A more exact equation is  
>![Equation 3](images/NACA-TR-831/Equation3.png)  

> h_a_o is the over-all coefficient of transfer of heat from the hot
air behind to the hot air within the corrugations and t_a_o is
the temperature of the air before entering the corrugations.
In the present analysis, equation (2) has been used throughout. 
A trial calculation has been made using equation (3);
the results of this calculation will be discussed later.
