## Abstract  

>The effect of modifying the gas passage of hollow metal airfoils 
by the additIon of internal fins and partitions was experimentally 
investigated and comparisons were made among a basic
unfinned airfoil section and two airfoil designs having metal fins
attached at the leading edge of the internal gas passage. An analysis 
considering the effects of heat conduction in the airfoil
metal was made to determine the internal modification effectiveness
that may be obtained in gas-heated components, such as turbojet-inlet 
guide vanes, support struts, hollow propeller blades, arid.
thin wings.
> 
> Over a wide range of heated-gas flow and tunnel-air velocity,
the increase in surface-heating rates with internal fin was
marked (up to 3.5 times), with the greatest increase occurring at
the leading edge where anti-icing heat requirements are most critical. 
Variations in the amount and the location of internal finning
and partitioning provided control over the local rates of surface
heat transfer and permitted efficient anti-icing utilization of
the gas-stream heat content.  

## Discussion  

This publication is long (45 pages), and densely packed with information. 
This review is longer than most, but for brevity omits some important sections:  

- Analysis of Flow Conditions  
- Anti-Icing Evaluation of Airfoil Sections  

Readers are encouraged to see those in the original publication.  

This publication details several important test procedures, 
including an assessment of thermocouple installation error 
(which was found to be substantial, if not corrected).  

The one-dimensional heat transfer analyses yield important information, 
and a two-dimensional thermal analysis is also included.  

While this publication is about gas-heated airfoils, 
the lessons can be applied to any thermal test.  

I consider this publication to be "required reading" for anyone doing anti-ice performance tests, 
or post-test analysis.  

> INTRODUCTION
> 
> Surface-ice prevention by the use of hot gas flowing through
hollow airfoil shapes has long been considered because of advantages 
in weight, simplicity, availability of heating medium, and
durability of installation. Use of the hot-gas method of anti-icing 
has been restricted, however, partly because of difficulty
in controlling the rate of heat dissipation over the chordal and
spanwise extent of the airfoil. A facility for concentrating the
flow of heat toward the leading-edge surfaces, where the heat
requirement for anti-icing is greatest, has been lacking. This
deficiency has been analytically and experimentally observed ad
is reported in references 1 to 5.
> 
> An investigation was conducted at the NACA Lewis laboratory
to evaluate by experimental comparisons the effect of internal
fins arid partitions on the anti-icing qualities of gas-heated
airfoil sections, applicable to such components as turbojet-inlet 
guide vanes, support struts, propeller blades, and thin wings.
Heat-transfer investigations were made in a two-dimensional duct
tunnel on two designs of finned airfoil sections as compared with
an unfinned section. Increases in airfoil surface temperatures
above tunnel-air temperatures were measured for various rates of
gas heating, for immersion in both dry and wet air streams, and
at airspeeds up to 300 miles per hour. Because of simpler and more
accurate experimental procedures, most of the data presented are
for dry air. The results obtained for dry air were applied to
anti-icing performance by use of the wet-air analysis given in
reference 1. The three airfoil sections were analyzed to evaluate
the important effects of heat conduction in the metal and the variations 
of convective heat-transfer rates in spanwise and chordwise
directions. Surface-heating improvement factors are presented for
two modified airfoil sections as compared with the original airfoil section.

> APPARATUS AND AIRFOILS

> Installation
> 
> The duct tunnel used for the gas-heating investigations is
shown in figure 1. Atmospheric air was induced through the tunnel
by suction from a centrifugal blower. The transparent test section
measured 2 by 20 inches.

![Figure 1. Installation of gas-heated airfoil section in 2- by 20-inch duct tunnel.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2126%2FFigure%201.png)  

> The airfoil sections were mounted in the center of the test
section, as shown in figure 2. The hot-gas supply for the models
was ducted through a rectangular diffuser, the approach section,
the model airfoil section, and the exit section. Contours of the
approach section, the exit section, arid the openings in the insulated 
side plates approximately matched the internal passage
through the unfinned airfoil section. Small differences in the
contours and slight misalinement of the assembly resulted, however,
with attendant disturbances to the internal-flow boundary-layer
characteristics. The hot gas was supplied from a compressed-air
system and was piped through a calibrated orifice, a regulating
valve, an electric heater, and then through a duct to the diffuser
and the models.

> Above-freezing cloud conditions were simulated in the tunnel
by the use of a water-spray nozzle located at the tunnel inlet.
Calibrations of the nozzle indicated that average cloud conditions 
at the tunnel center line just ahead of the models were approximately 
as follows: volume-median droplet diameter, 15 to 20 microns;
liquid-water content at 275 miles per hour, 1.3 grams per cubic
meter; liquid-water content at l00 miles per hour, 1.7 ams per
cubic meter.
> 
> Airfoil sections
> 
> Details and dimensions of the three airfoil sections investigated 
are presented in figure 3 and table I. An NACA 0012 symmetrical airfoil 
section was selected for investigation because it is
a basic shape about which other icing information is known and maybe 
considered somewhat representative of propeller-blade sections,
struts, wings, and the fore part of turning vanes.

![Figure 3. Detail of three case-heated airfoil sections.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2126%2FFigure%203.png)  

> Airfoil section A is a hollow steel section with an Insulating
partition starting at 0.46 chord. Section B is the sante as section A,
with the addition of two sheet-metal fins that are attached to the
leading edge. Section C has shorter and thicker fins that are tapered
toward the tips and an enlarged center partition to reduce the gas-
flow-passage area. When the airfoil Is assembled with the tunnel
side walls, the hollow region behind the partition becomes a dead-air 
chamber.
> 
> Instrumentation
> 
> Surface-temperature thermocouples were installed on the sections 
in 16 locations (fig. 3). One metal temperature thermocouple
was located at the leading edge of the internal passage of each
section and one thermocouple was installed at the tip of one fin
of both finned sections. The tunnel-air temperature was measured
at the tunnel inlet and. two fixed gas-temperature rakes of four
bare thermocouples each were located on the gas-passage center
line (fig. 2).  
> 
> Iron-constantan thermocouple junctions were spot-welded to
the airfoil metal surfaces. The leads were rolled to a thickness
of approximately 0.003 inch and attached to and insulated froth
the metal by a thin coating of cement. Front the junctions, the
leads extended to corresponding holes in the side wall (fig. 2).
> 
> The total protrusion of thermocouples and leads above the metal
surface was approximately 0.007 inch. The installations were
faired into the airfoil contour as inch as possible and an effort
was made to keep the metal surfaces clean.
> 
> Inasmuch as all the models were symmetrical and at zero angle
of attack, the upper and lower surface thermocouples yielded very.
nearly the same temperature patterns and served as a check on the
instrumentation.
> 
> PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
> 
> Thermocouple Attachment and Surface Coating
> 
> Gas-heated airfoils' are difficult to provide with accurate
surface-temperature instrumentation. If the thermocouple junction 
and adjacent leads protrude into either the air or hot-gas
stream, an appreciable error may be introduced by heat conduction
along the leads. Projecting leads can also seriously disturb the
stream-flow characteristics, such as causing transition to turbulent 
flow in the air stream and blockage to the gas-stream flow.
Even if the thermocouple leads were fully embedded beneath the
surface, their tunnels in the thin metal skin would still constitute 
heat barriers disruptive to the normal skin-temperature
gradients. By simpler means, the instrumentation may be completely 
covered with a smooth surface coating, such as paint,
that will minimize most of the aforementioned difficulties. Unfortunately, 
the temperature gradient through the surface coating is
introduced as a new problem. Such a coating removes the thermocouple
from the exposed surface and leaves doubt as to the actual surface
temperature.
> 
> In order to obtain a measure of these surface-temperature
errors, a preliminary comparison was made under the same flow and
heating conditions between section A with bare instrumentation,
as previously described, and with tie same instrumented section
externally coated with aircraft primer and a final coat of black
lacquer so that no surface irregularities remained. The paint
thickness was approximately 0.010 inch, which was sufficient to
cover the thermocouples by about 0.003 inch. This paint coating
is similar in application to that of many propellers and wings in
use and has also been used in previous icing investigations.
> 
> The effect of the paint coating is illustrated in figure 4,
where the chordwise variation of surface-temperature rise above
dry tunnel-air temperature is plotted for the bare .nd painted
section A at two flow conditions. The painted airfoil indicated
the higher surface temperatures; the greatest increase over the
bare model occurred at the leading edge and at the highest values
of gas flow and air velocity investigated. The greatest and
smallest differences in stagnation-point temperatures between
the two models were determined from data not shown as approximately
50° and 30° F, respectively. During icing conditions, however,
calculations indicate that these differentials would be reduced
to the order of 15° to 10° F.

![Figure 4. Chordwise distribution of surface-temperature rise for
bare and painted airfoil section A under two flow conditions.
Mean gas temperature, 370° F.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2126%2FFigure%204.png)  

> Because the maximum paint effect occurred at the leading edge,
the gradient through the paint coating and the reduced conductive
loss in the thermocouple leads were believed to account for most of
the paint effect and the improved surface smoothness was of lesser
importance. Thermal-conductivity values for paints are too uncertain 
to allow calculation of temperature gradients through paint
films for known rates of heat transfer. The available information,
however, indicates that more than half of the observed temperature
increase with surface painting is due to the thermal gradient in
the paint film and that the balance is caused by local thermocouple
errors inherent in the bare surface-thermocouple installation.
> 
> These comparisons illustrate that thermocouples attached to
a metal surface and covered with a faired coating of paint or cement
will indicate temperatures several degrees higher than the exposed
surface, which, for example, may be undergoing icing while safe
anti-icing temperatures are being indicated. Thus, to insure conservative 
surface-temperature indication, the bare surface-thermocouple 
installation was employed in this investigation, with
care taken that the leads were rolled as fine (0.003 in. thick) as
durability considerations permitted.
> 
> Datum Air Temperature
> 
> The local kinetic, or datum air, temperature ta over the
models in the dry-air investigations was taken as the constant
value indicated by the static-air-temperature thermocouple at the
tunnel inlet. (All synbols used throughout this report are
defined in the appendix.) This simplification avoids calculation
of adiabatic temperature drops, local velocities, and kinetic-recovery 
coefficients. For the range of airspeeds involved, this
approximation may entail a maximum theoretical error of 3° F. For
an experimental check on the kinetic heating effect, the models
were subjected to the maximum air velocity Vo of 300 miles per
hour with zero gas flow. The surface thermocouples indicated temperatures 
within 1° F and the tunnel-inlet thermocouple indicated
a maximum disagreement of 1 1/2° F with the average model-surface 
temperature. By considering the magnitude of the surface-temperature-rise 
differentials that usually resulted in the investigations, this
approximation of air temperature was deemed satisfactory for all
cases.

> The preceding discussion applies equally well to the effective
gas temperatures, as indicated by the gas-temperature probes, because
of the relatively low maximum gas velocity (110 mph) and negligible
amounts of radiation at the operating temperatures.
> 
> In the few vet-air investigations, the datum air temperature ta
in the spray cloud was determined from a calibration of unheated
model temperatures taken over a range of air velocities, liquid-water 
contents, and dry-air temperatures at the tunnel inlet. No
measurements of the tunnel-air humidity were made during the calibration; 
consequently, the datum temperatures In the wet-air
investigations were less reliable than in the dry-air cases.
> 
> The trailing-edge surface temperatures have not been plotted
in the subsequent figures. The trailing half of each section exhibited
a rapidly decreasing surface temperature, which at the trailing edge
approached the datum air temperature to within a maximum difference
of 35° F (section C, gas flow of 325 lb/hr and air velocity of
102 mph).
> 
> Conduction Losses
> 
> Because of the narrowness of the duct tunnel, thermal conduction 
from the heated region of the models to the insulated side
supports and the trailing half of the models was suspected of
influencing the temperature indication at the model center lines.
A "no-load" investigation indicated that the losses due to conduction 
into the side walls appreciably affected the surface-temperature 
indication. A thorough calibration was not made, however, and the 
indicated values of surface temperature are presented
in the subsequent analysis. The error involved is greatest at the
low air velocities and regions near the midpoint of chord; neither
case is critical to anti-icing performance.
> 
> CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURE
> 
> The airfoil-surface-temperature patterns over each of the
three models were obtained in dry tunnel air at velocities V0
of 102, 160, 210, and 275 miles per hour, gas-flow rates w of
100 and 325 pounds per hour, and a mean gas temperature tgm of
37Q0 F. Surface temperatures were also taken in dry air at a velocity 
of 300 miles per hour with gas flows of 100, 150, 240, and
325 pounds per hour through each of the sections and with the samè
mean gas temperature. In order to determine the effect of gas temperature, 
surface temperatures of each section were obtained in dry
air at a velocity of 102 miles per hour for a range of mean gas
temperatures from 125° to 375° F. The datum air temperature ranged
between 32° and 80° F.
> 
> For the aforementioned conditions and throughout the heat-transfer 
analysis and discussion, dry tunnel-air conditions are presented. 
Only a few comparisons are made with wet-air conditions
in the tunnel to afford a check on the analysis of anti-icing heat
requirements. Wet-surface temperatures over the three airfoil
sections were taken at tunnel-air velocities of 102 and 275 miles
per hour with gas flows of both 100 and 325 pounds per hour. Wet
datum ar temperatures were obtained between 350 and 630 F.
> 
> Steady-state flow was established for each condition by allowing
at least 10 minutes between any significant change in flow or temperature 
values and the recording of data. Consistency of the data
was good, with reruns of the same conditions agreeing within an
average discrepancy in surface temperature of 30° F. The recording
potentiometer was considered accurate to within 2° F.

for the three airfoil sections at various flow conditions Is
shown in figure 5.

>Comparisons may be made directly among the
following conditions:  
> (a) airfoil sections A, B, and C with the
same heating and flow conditions in which the increased surface
heating due to internal fins and partitions is clearly evident;  
> (b) section C with air velocities of 275 and 102 miles per hour
but with the same gas-flow rate and temperature, illustrating the
magnitude of air-velocity effect; 
> (c) section B with gas flows of
325 and 100 pounds per hour and the same air velocity and gas
temperature; and  
> (d) section C with dry and wet tunnel air and the
sane heating and flow rates.   
> Comparison (d) shows that the airfoil
leading edge in cloud conditions was considerably chilled by evaporation 
of impinging moisture but the surface became effectively dry
at approximately 3.5 inches from stagnation and the two surface-temperature 
curves very nearly coincided beyond that point.
> 
> The surface-temperature rise at the stagnation point of the
three airfoil sections as a function of the gas-temperature differential  
tg,m - ta is shown in figure 6. Data are presented for section C in 
both dry- and wet-air conditions. This figure confirms
the expected linear relation between gas temperature and surface
temperature, other conditions being constant, and indicates the consistency 
and reliability of the installation and the instrumentation
used. The three dry-air examples show data points scattered less
that ±5 percent from the plotted straight lines. The wet-air curve
indicates the progressive reduction in surface-temperature rise for
increments of increasing gas-temperature differential, caused by
the dependence of surface-evaporation rate on actual surface
temperatures.

> Effectiveness of Internal Fins and Partitions
> 
> The effectiveness of gas-heated airfoils with internal-fin
modifications in anti-icing can be measured by comparing, under
the same conditions, a finned section with an unfinned section
in regard to (a) increased surface heating rates and (b) reduced
heated-gas requirements. With fins, the increase of the surface
heat-transfer rate for a fixed condition of air and gas flows can
be determined from the surface-temperature rise above the datum
air temperature tsta because in dry air the heat-transfer coéf-
ficient is nearly constant over the normal range of temperatures.
Thus,
qa = ha(ts - ta) ~= C1(ts - ta)  (1)  
Similarly, with fins, the decrease in the required heat content
of the internal gas flow for a fixed condition of blade-surface
heat transfer can be determined from the gas-flow rate if the
mean gas temperature is held constant, or
Qi = w cp(tg,m-ta) = C2 w   (2)  
> 
> Modification effectiveness. - If equation (1) is considered,
a comparison of surface heat transfer between finned and unfinned
airfoil sections can be expressed by the ratio
(qa,f / qa,u) = e ~= (ts-ta)f / (ts-ta)u  (3)  
> 
> that may be termed modification effectiveness. The chordwise variation 
of local modification effectiveness, as indicated for the
finned sections B and C, is plotted in figure 7 for various flow
conditions. The increased heat transfer through finned sections
was marked. In each case, the improvement was greatest in the
region of the stagnation point, the area most critical for anti-icing 
of gas-heated airfoils. The increase in surface heat transfer, 
denoted by e, reached a maximum of 3.5 at the leading edge
of section C. The increase at the stagnation point was from 30 to
80 percent greater than for the average of the whole heated-surface
area. The fin design of section C was always more effective in
increasing surface heat transfer than was section B.  

![Figure 7. Chordwise variations of modification effectiveness
for sections B and C.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2126%2FFigure%207.png)  

> Inspection of the variables involved in figure 7 shows that
modification effectiveness increased with air velocity, decreased
with increasing gas flow, and was substantially independent of the
gas-temperature differential tgm - ta. Accordingly, the modification 
effectiveness was investigated as a function of the external 
to internal flow ratio v/w and correlated well when plotted
as a function of the nondimensional mass-velocity ratio g ρ0 v0 / Gu = Y
(fig. 8). The improvement in surface heat transfer due to the addition 
of the internal configurations investigated for sections B
and C is also shown in figure 8.

![Figure 8. Modification effectiveness as function of mass-velocity
ratio. Mean gas temperature, 370° F.](/images%2FNACA-TN-2126%2FFigure%208.png)  

>Relative modification effectiveness. - Another concept of
modification effectiveness, a comparison of the internal effective
conductance hg Ag between modified and unmodified airfoil sections, 
may also be applied. The effective conductance of heat
from the gas stream to internally convoluted airfoil sections
cannot be easily determined by theoretical means but can be experimentally 
determined by its external effects. For simplicity, a
negligible temperature gradient is assumed in the heat-flow path
across the airfoil skin material in the following equations; in
some cases, however, the gradient has an appreciable effect as
will be subsequently shown:

> 
> From equations (8) and (10) to (12), the external effective
conductance ha,av Aa is seen to be essentially constant between
finned and unfinned airfoil sections compared at the same flow
conditions. The slight dependence of ha on ts is unimportant
and is neglected in these calculations. Accordingly, equation (8)
reduces to

> The factor E in equation (13) can thus be determined as the
surface-average modification effectiveness e 7 multiplied by
the unfinned-to-finned-section ratio of the gas-to-surface temperature 
differential (tg,m - ts)av. With the factor E, data
taken at different values of gas temperature can be related on a
common basis. The data in figure 8 are replotted in terms of the
factor E in figure 9. The values of E at the stagnation point
were calculated using equations (4) to (6) and (13) for point
values as was done, for integrated averages over the heated-surface
area.  
> 
> The curves for the heated-surface averages In figure 9 approach
constancy with the mass-velocity ratio Y. The variation of E with
Y is due to the temperature gradient through the metal skin, which
was neglected in the derivation of E. The greatest variation is in
the curves for the stagnation-point values, resulting from the
large leading-edge temperature gradients.

> Heat Transfer in Finned Leading Edge
> 
> The chordwise distribution of temperature and heat transfer
in the leading-edge region of finned airfoil section C has been
determined for the following conditions: gas flow, 325 pounds per
hour; tunnel-air velocity, 275 miles per hour; and gas-temperature
differential, 314° F. The temperature gradient through the tapered
fin was found from a series of incremental heat-transmission calculations 
beginning at the known fin-tip temperature and by utilizing the 
indicated gas-temperature profile as well as the theoretical 
gas-film heat-transfer coefficient. The relaxation method
presented in reference 12 was used for the fore part of section C
to obtain the isotherms shown in figure 13. The external air heat-transfer 
coefficient determined from the development in figure 13
agreed approximately with the theoretical ha (equations (10) and
(11)). The heat-flow channels illustrate how the leading-edge fins
increase the heat transfer and temperature at the critical stagnation 
region. Half of the heat flow in the tapered fins is
directed into the first 3/8 inch of the airfoil surface.

## Conclusions  

> From an investigation of three gas-heated airfoils, one hollow
and two modified with internal fins and partitions for improving
anti-icing heat-transfer characteristics, the following results were
obtained:  
>1. The local surface-heating rate for ice prevention on gas-heated 
airfoils was increased up to 3.5 times by the addition of
metal fins attached at the leading edge of the internal gas passage,
which was also reduced in area.  
>2. The surface-heating increase in dry-air flow was from 30 to
80 percent greater at the stagnation point than for the average over
the entire heated area of the airfoil sections investigated. The
greatest increase in surface heating was obtained with relatively
thick tapered fins and with a gas-passage restricting partition.  
>3. Over the range of air and gas flows investigated, the
relative modification effectiveness, defined as the ratio of internal 
effective conductance between the modified and unmodified airfoil 
sections, was approximately as follows.  
>4. Rates of hot-gas flow through the original unfinned airfoil
section were reduced approximately 64 and 86 percent by the addition
of constant-thickness or tapered fins, respectively, when the total
heat transfer through the heated-surface area was constant.   
>5. At a gas flow of 325 pounds per hour, a gas-temperature
differential of 310° F, and an air velocity of 275 miles per hour,
the magnitude of surface heat transfer in the stagnation regions
was approximately as follows. For the tapered-finned section, this heating rate represented a
surface-temperature rise in severe icing conditions of approximately 
57° F above a wet datum-air temperature of 0° F.  
>6. For the flow, heating, arid icing conditions presented in
the previous paragraph, the temperature drop through a 0.010-inch-
thick surface paint coating on the leading edge of the unfinned
section was calculated to range from 10° to 15° F.   
>7. Fins and partitions in the flow passage of gas-heated airfoils 
had multiple effects in increasing the local surface heat-transfer 
rates and in creating design variables that permit
more effective control over the chordal and spanwise distribution
of heat flow.
