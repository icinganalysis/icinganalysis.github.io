## Introduction  

Five of these publications are from the "Jet Penetration" section, 
and one is from the "Windshield Ice Protection" section 
of [The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications](The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md).  

The first five publications determine by test the characteristics of air jets entering a moving airstream. 
The final publication applies this technology to windshield rain removal.  

Windshield rain removal is often designed in the same group as ice protection. 
SAE AIR-1168/4 is titled “Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection” [SAE Aerospace Applied Thermodynamics Manual, 1969 (regularly updated, currently document [sae.org](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air1168/4/))]. 
A design group I worked in was named "Ice and Rain Protection". 

That was historically where the knowledge of water drops, 
air flow control, and mechanical systems resided. 

So, it is not surprising that a rain-removal publication is in the 
["Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"]({filename}/The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications.md).    

Air jets are also of interest for hot gas ice protection. 
While not detailed in these publications, 
the "piccolo" spray tubes commonly used for wing anti-ice is one, specialized application. 
Also, analyzing the hot air exhaust, and if adjacent structure might get too hot, is another application.
