Title: Hard to find publications  
Date: 2023-01-15 12:00  

###_"The documents were so old, however, that they were not listed in the modern computerized library search systems, and some of these documents were out of print." [^1]_  

![Several people using a library. 
Many are seated at tables reading books. 
There are book shelves, file cabinets for index cards, 
and a microfische reader.

I can usually get even rare and obscure publications 
through inter-library loan from my public library, 
but these were reported as having no loanable copies available.  

I would appreciate any help anyone can offer 
finding them as loanable print copies or digitally.  

##Could only find at google books    

- NACA conference on some problems of aircraft operation [at] Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, Cleveland, Ohio, November 17, 18 1954 https://books.google.com/books?id=bsxQAAAAYAAJ  

##Recently made available online  

- Elliot, H. W.: Cloud Droplet Camera. Published by National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, 1947 [nrc-publications.canada.ca](https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/object/?id=96afb7f7-b81c-4a3f-b754-3ee7d93e7233)    
- Smith, E. L.: The design of fluid anti-icing systems. National Aeronautical Establishment (Canada) LR-64, 1953. [nrc-publications.canada.ca](https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/object/?id=f64c5521-eb28-4569-9ff6-32b038394078)    

##Might be available online soon  

- Orr, J.L., Milsum, J.H. and Rush, C.K.: “Electro-Thermal De-Icing Systems: Their Design and Control”. NRC NAE Report LR-70, March 1953.  
- Rush. C. K.: The N.R.C. icing wind tunnels and some of their problems. Ottawa: National Aeronautical Establishment 1955.  

##No Loanable Copies Available  

- Katz, R.E., and Cunningham, R.M.: Instruments for Measuring Atmospheric Factors Related to Ice Formation on Airplanes- II, Aircraft Icing Instruments M.I.T. Icing Research Laboratory Report. Contract No. W-33-038-ac-14165. Mar. 1948  
- Vonnegut, B.: "Instruments for Measuring Atmospheric Factors Related to Ice Formation on Airplanes". De-Icing Res. Lab., Dept. Meteorology, M.I.T., April 1946  

##Could not find except by reference    

I have found one-line references to these, but no on-line sources 
(ntrs.nasa.gov, google, worldcat, dtic, semanticscholar, archive.org, etc.), nor loanable library copies.  

- Chandler, H. C., Jr.: Survey of Aircraft Anti-icing Equipment. NACA restricted report, Feb. 27, 1942.  
- Howlett, D. P.: Ice Detectors. (paper presented at 1961 Aircraft Ice Protection Conference, D. Napier & Son, Ltd.)  

##On a list of restricted/classified NASA reports  

We may never get to see these, 
unless one has a security clearance and a "need to know".
(Must be some really good info to still be restricted 80+ years later.)  

However, I have seen copies of some other publications that are on this list, 
so things may have changed and they might someday be available.
