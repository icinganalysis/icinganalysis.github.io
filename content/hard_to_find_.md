### _"The documents were so old, however, that they were not listed in the modern computerized library search systems, and some of these documents were out of print." [^1]_  

![Several people using a library. 
Many are seated at tables reading books. 
There are book shelves, file cabinets for index cards, 
and a microfische reader.

## Summary  

I can usually get even rare and obscure publications 
through inter-library loan from my public library, 
but these were reported as having no loanable copies available.  

## Discussion  

I have tried the many excellent search tips at 
[Gwern's Internet Search Tips](https://gwern.net/search), 
and now I am at the "request help" stage.

I would appreciate any help anyone can offer 
finding them as loanable print copies or digitally.

## On a list of restricted/classified NASA reports  

We may never get to see these, 
unless one has a security clearance and a "need to know".
(Must be some really good info to still be restricted 80+ years later.)  

However, I have seen copies of some other publications that are on this list, 
so things may have changed, and they might someday be available.

- Rodert, Lewis A., Clousing, Lawrence A., and McAvoy, William H.: Recent Flight Research on Ice Prevention. NACA-ARR, Jan. 1942. (Might be similar to NACA-WR-A-34, April 1942, which is available at the NTRS [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930093056))  

## A Mystery  

A reader sent in this image. 
No context information is available, and the reader does not know what document this came from:  

![Typical ice shapes from flight test.](images%2FTypical%20ice%20shapes%20from%20flight%20test.png)

Do you know where it came from? 
If so, email me at the contact information further below.

Helicopters are mentioned (CH-45, CH-53, Chinook). 

To me, it appears to be from a document discussing ice impact test article sizes, 
the "Equival    ent Ice Ball Size". 
I have seen several approaches to determining ice impact test article size. 
The arithmetic of this one escapes me. 
It does not appear to be an equivalent volume, 
and the "5.02 in" equivalent diameter case may be a typo (or a different value, the figure is hard to read).  

I speculate it is from the 1970s to 1980s, 
when a great amount of helicopter icing tests were conducted.
