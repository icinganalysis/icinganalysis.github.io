Title: Hard to find publications  
Date: 2023-01-30 12:00

### _"The documents were so old, however, that they were not listed in the modern computerized library search systems, and some of these documents were out of print." [^1]_  

![Several people using a library. 
Many are seated at tables reading books. 
There are book shelves, file cabinets for index cards, 
and a microfische reader.

## Summary  

I can usually get even rare and obscure publications 
through inter-library loan from my public library, 
but these were reported as having no loanable copies available.  

## Discussion  

I have tried the many excellent search tips at 
[Gwern's Internet Search Tips](https://gwern.net/search), 
and now I am at the "request help" stage.

I would appreciate any help anyone can offer 
finding them as loanable print copies or digitally.  

## Could only find at google books    

- NACA conference on some problems of aircraft operation [at] Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, Cleveland, Ohio, November 17, 18 1954 [books.google.com](https://books.google.com/books?id=bsxQAAAAYAAJ)

## Might be available online soon

- Rush, C. K.: The N.R.C. icing wind tunnels and some of their problems. Ottawa: National Aeronautical Establishment 1955.  

## No Loanable Copies Available  

- Katz, R.E., and Cunningham, R.M.: Instruments for Measuring Atmospheric Factors Related to Ice Formation on Airplanes- II, Aircraft Icing Instruments M.I.T. Icing Research Laboratory Report. Contract No. W-33-038-ac-14165. Mar. 1948  
- Vonnegut, B.: "Instruments for Measuring Atmospheric Factors Related to Ice Formation on Airplanes". De-Icing Res. Lab., Dept. Meteorology, M.I.T., April 1946  

## Could not find except by reference    

I have found one-line references to these, but no on-line sources 
(ntrs.nasa.gov, google, worldcat, dtic, semanticscholar, archive.org, etc.), nor loanable library copies.  

- Chandler, H. C., Jr.: Survey of Aircraft Anti-icing Equipment. NACA restricted report, Feb. 27, 1942.  
- Howlett, D. P.: Ice Detectors. (paper presented at 1961 Aircraft Ice Protection Conference, D. Napier & Son, Ltd.)  

## On a list of restricted/classified NASA reports  

We may never get to see these, 
unless one has a security clearance and a "need to know".
(Must be some really good info to still be restricted 80+ years later.)  

However, I have seen copies of some other publications that are on this list, 
so things may have changed and they might someday be available.
