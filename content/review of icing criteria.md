##Abstract

_(A formal abstract was not included, I am using the introductory paragraphs here)._

> Rational design of ice-protection equipment requires a definition of
the atmospheric conditions in which the system is expected to operate.
The primary parameters are liquid water content, effective drop diameter
and temperature. Also of interest are altitude and the horizontal and
vertical extent of the conditions.

> The correspondence between an optimum envelope of design conditions and
the actual statistical distributions of the parameters as found in the
atmosphere is complex. Actual conditions in the atmosphere are highly
variable, and the most extreme conditions are of brief duration and small
extent. The probability of encountering severe conditions is also a
function of flight operating procedures and climatological factors. The
selection of design conditions also require consideration of the tolerance
of the system to temporary overloading and especially the ability to
recover after short periods in extreme conditions.

##Key points


##Discussion


Lewis offers summation of the NACA-era effort, and some additional data.

>  Most of the flight measurements of liquid water content and effective
drop diameter were made by means of the rotating-cylinder.
