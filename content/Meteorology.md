_from "FLIGHT INVESTIGATION OF METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS CONDUCIVE TO AIRCRAFT ICING", William Lewis, NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention A Compilation of Papers Presented by NACA Staff Members. 6505/NACA-1947/8, 1947._  

Early [Ice Protection Systems]({filename}ice%20protection.md) were designed without detailed 
knowledge of icing conditions in clouds. 
While successful designs were accomplished with extensive iteration and flight test, 
more optimal design is only possible if the conditions are known beforehand.  

>Progress ... has been handicapped by the lack of sufficient data on the meteorological factors.  
>_NACA-TN-1855, 1949._  

A better understanding of the icing atmosphere evolved in parallel with improved 
[Meteorological Instruments]({filename}instruments.md) in the years 1944 to 1952.
Two of the authors (Kline, Lewis) were meteorologists from the US Weather Bureau. 
This helped put the data on a sound scientific basis.

Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in  
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md) 
in the "Meteorology of Icing Clouds" section. 
While the publications are important and useful, 
they did not directly affect the icing design values adopted in regulations. 
I will review those in their own thread, to be published at a later date.  
Perkins was quite productive during his career at NACA and NASA.
