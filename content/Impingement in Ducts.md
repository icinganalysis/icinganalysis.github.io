## Summary  

The impingement of water-drops in idealized elbow ducts is calculated with potential flow.  

## Abstract  

NACA-TN-2999

>Trajectories were determined for droplets in air flowing through
90° elbows especially designed for two-dimensional potential motion with
low pressure losses. The elbows were established by selecting as walls
of each elbow two streamlines of the flow field produced by a complex
potential function that establishes a two-dimensional flow around a 90°
bend. An unlimited number of elbows with slightly different shapes can
be established by selecting different pairs of streamlines as walls.
The elbows produced by the complex potential function selected are suitable 
for use in aircraft air-intake ducts.  
The droplet impingement data derived from the trajectories are presented 
along with equations in such a manner that the collection efficiency, 
the area, the rate, and the distribution of droplet impingement
can be determined for any elbow defined by any pair of streamlines within 
a portion of the flow field established by the complex potential function. 
Coordinates for some typical streamlines of the flow field and
velocity components for several points along these streamlines are presented in tabular form.

## Discussion  

In the titles here, the use of potential flow to determine water-drop trajectories gets pushed to the limit. 
In a demonstration of the pragmatism that ran through much of the ice protection development at NACA, 
investigators produced results on configurations that could be analyzed that were close enough to 
real aircraft geometries. 

Most of the discussion will center around NACA-TN-3770.  

### NACA-TN-3770

>The air flow through conventional elbows (constant cross-sectional
area) cannot be established by potential theory, and, furthermore, the
flow is usually three-dimensional. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate 
droplet trajectories for conventional elbows. Elbows may be designed, 
however, for which the flow field is determined by two-dimensional 
potential theory (ref. 13). For these elbows the pressure
losses are usually less than those for conventional elbows of comparable
size and shape. (Experimentally determined pressure losses presented in
ref. 14 for the basic elbow of this report are about one-third of those
for a conventional elbow of comparable size.)

>Elbow Geometry and Flow Field  
As in the case of the 90° elbow of reference 12, the air-flow field
for the elbow studied in this report was not determined for a given elbow, 
but was determined by establishing from potential theory a two-dimensional 
flow field that makes a 60° turn. From this flow field two
streamlines were selected as walls of the elbow. Selection of the complex 
potential function and streamlines as walls was based upon the following criteria:  
(1) The air-flow field should be uniform and rectilinear at some
point before and after the bend, in order that the elbow may be fitted
to straight ducts.  
(2) The resultant velocity at any point inside the elbow should not
exceed the velocity U where the flow is uniform and rectilinear. This
criterion was selected so as to minimize possible flow separation.  
(3) No streamline should have singular points (0 or infinite velocity) within the elbow.

>For this droplet impingement study the streamline pattern of figure 1 [or 2] is divided 
into three classes of elbows:  
(1) The elbow defined by streamlines ψ = πlU/12 and ψ = 4πlU/12
is defined as the basic elbow.  
(2) Elbows defined by any pair of streamlines between those of the
basic elbow or by one streamline of the basic elbow and any other intermediate 
streamline are designated as supplementary elbows.  
(3) Elbows whose outside wall is defined by the streamline
ψ = 15πlU/32 are designated as pocket elbows.

>Maximum extent of impingement. - The maximum extent of impingement
for the basic elbow S'm for a given combination of K and Reo is determined 
from figure 5 by the maximum value of S'm for any value of xa
within the walls of the elbow. For some combinations of K and Reo
such as K = 1 and Reo = 32 (fig. 5(b)), impingement occurs throughout
the entire length of the elbow with some droplets passing through without
impinging, as is illustrated in figure 4(a). For other combinations of
K and Reo, such as K = 4 and Reo = 128 (fig. 5(c)), the impingement
of all droplets is confined to a portion of the outside wall, as is
illustrated in figure 4(b).

## Conclusions  

NACA-TN-2999

> CONCLUDING REMARKS
The special 90° elbows for which droplet impingement data are presented 
in this report are suitable for use in aircraft air-intake ducts
and as droplet inertia separators. For droplet inertia separators, it
may be necessary to combine two or more elbows so as to produce a turn
of 180° or more in order to obtain satisfactory separation of droplets
from the air. The impingement data for supplementary elbows defined by
streamlines near the inside wall of the basic elbow can probably be used
to approximate droplet impingement in conventional elbows with long
radii of curvature, because streamlines in this region are approximately
equidistant apart at all points throughout the elbow (see figs. 2 and 4
and table II).  
The maximum extent of impingement for these elbows varies directly
with the free-stream Reynolds number and inversely with inertia parameter. 
In contrast to airfoils, the maximum extent of impingement varies
inversely with droplet size. For a given value of free-stream Reynolds
number, the collection efficiency for the basic elbow increases with increasing 
values of inertia parameter until all droplets that enter the
elbow impinge upon the outside wall. The value of inertia parameter for
which the collection efficiency becomes unity increases with increasing
values of free-stream Reynolds number. The length of the outside wall
of the basic elbow is 6.46 S units (distance from entrance), and the maximum 
local rate of droplet impingement occurs between S = 3 and S = 5
for all investigated combinations of free-stream Reynolds number and inertia parameter.  
The use of elbows and bends designed according to potential theory
for aircraft ducts and inlets has two advantages: The pressure losses
are much less than those for conventional elbows or any arbitrary bend;
and droplet trajectories with respect to the elbow are obtainable, since
the air-flow field is easily established by potential theory. Elbows designed 
for potential flow need not be restricted to symmetrical 90°
bends, for potential functions exist by which elbows with various sizes,
odd shapes and angles of bend, and different entrance and exit cross-sectional areas can be designed.

>CONCLUDING REMARKS  
The 60° elbows for which droplet impingement data are presented in
this report are suitable for aircraft air-inlet ducts and would probably
have lower pressure losses than bends with constant cross-sectional
areas. However, these impingement data are based upon theoretical calculations 
for an ideal fluid flow and hence there might be some differences between 
theoretical and experimental impingement for the same elbow.
Although the collection efficiency of the 60° pocket elbow with the
same entrance width as the basic elbow is less than for the 60° basic elbow
and the pocket elbow would not be as useful as a droplet inertia separator, 
the pocket elbow has some impingement characteristics that may be
useful. The droplet impingement for pocket elbows is limited to a much
smaller area than for the basic elbow; therefore, less area would have
to be heated to prevent or remove ice. There is also a region from the
entrance to a surface distance of 3.75 on the outside wall of the pocket
elbow where there is no impingement. The impingement data for supplementary 
elbows defined by streamlines near the inside wall of the basic
elbow can probably be used to approximate droplet impingement in conventional 
elbows with long radii of curvature, because the streamlines in
this region are approximately equidistant at all points throughout the
elbow.

It is a pity that NACA-TN-3770 is not more widely cited. 
It includes a comparison of 60° and 90° duct bends that may be instructive. 
I know of more aircraft applications with 60°-ish bends (such as the L-1011 and 727 engine inlet ducts) than for 90° bends.
