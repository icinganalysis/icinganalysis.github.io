#Ice Shapes and Their Effects Thread

This thread will cover ice shapes and the aerodynamic effects of the ice.

This will primarily cover ice shapes on unprotected surfaces.

There are additional publications on ice shapes for deicing systems and propellers that will not be reviewed here.

###Review of the "Ice Shapes and Their Effects" thread so far

In this thread, we saw:

An almost "lost gem" of the NACA-era, [NACA-TN-313, "The Formation of Ice upon Airplanes in Flight"] with, in 1929: 
- Description of supercooled large drop (SLD) icing conditions  
- "Detect and exit" icing mitigation strategy  
- Natural icing flight tests of icephobic materials  
- Identification of different types of icing  

The effect of "protuberances" on an airfoil section lift and drag in [NACA-TR-446, "Airfoil Section Characteristics as Affected by Protuberances"]({filename}NACA-TR-446.md)  

The effects of simulated residual ice in [NACA-WR-L-292, "Effects of a Simulated Ice Formation on the Aerodynamic Characteristics of an Airfoil"]({filename}NACA-WR-L-292.md)     

Airplane levels effects of icing are measured, and broken into major components in [NACA-TN-1598, "Effects of Ice Formations on Airplane Performance in Level Cruising Flight"]({filename}NACA-TN-1598.md)
