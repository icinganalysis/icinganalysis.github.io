Title: The Non-NACA "NACA" Icing Publications
Category: NACA

The 132 publications in the “Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications” [^1] 
include seven citations that were not published by NACA. 
This also has an effect of making some them difficult to find online:  

- Two NASA publications
    - Perkins, Porter J.: Summary of Statistical Icing Cloud Data Measured Over United States and North Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Ocean During Routine Aircraft Operations. NASA Memo 1-19-59E, 1959.  [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19810068860/page/n9/mode/2up)  
    - Gray, Vernon H.: Prediction of Aerodynamic Penalties Caused by Ice Formations on Various Airfoils. NASA-TM-D-2166, 1964. [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19810068590)

- Two references to NASA-TM-X-54700, which purportedly documents the “Compilation of the Paper Presented at NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation".  However, the citation NASA-TM-X-54700 appears to be an error, as on the ntrs it is listed as “Space radiation- a compilation and discussion”. The “Compilation of the Paper Presented at NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation" is available as a print book.  
    - von Glahn, Uwe H.: "Some Considerations for the Need of Icing Protection of High-Speed, High-Altitude Airplanes", NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation. NASA-TM-82265, 1954.  
        - The NTRS link does not have a file download available.  
    - Gray, Vernon H.: "Icing Conditions to be Expected in Operation of High-Speed, High-Altitude Airplanes". NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation. NASA-TM-82266, 1954.  
        - The NTRS link does not have a file download available.  
        
- Three presentations by NACA staff given at conferences  
    - Gray, Vernon H.: "Correlation of Airfoil Ice Formations and Their Aerodynamic Effects With Impingement and Flight Conditions". SAE preprint No. 225 (paper presented at SAE National Aeronautics Meeting), October 1957.  
        - The NTRS link does not have a download available.  
        - It is available for purchase from the SAE.   
        - this appears to be similar to [^2]  
    - Gray, Vernon H.: "Heat Requirements for Ice Prevention on Gas-Heated Propellers". SAE preprint No. 424 (paper presented at SAE Annual Meeting), 1950.  
        - The [NTRS link](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19810068634) does not have a download available.  
        - It is available for purchase from the SAE.  
    - von Glahn, Uwe H.: "The Icing Problem", presented at Ottawa AGARD Conference. AG 19/P9, 10-17 June 1955.  
        - The NTRS link does not have a download available.  
        - I have not been able to find this.  
        - It appears to be what is reproduced in full in [^1] as "The Icing Problem- Current Status and Research".
