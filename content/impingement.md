# Water Drop Impingement on Surfaces Thread

## Summary  

Water-drop impingement quantification is key to aircraft ice protection design.  

## Introduction  

Part of designing for aircraft icing is determining how much ice the airplane can accumulate. 
For ice protection systems, determining how much water that might freeze hits a surface is a key detail. 

An important effect is that the airflow around a surface such as a wing airfoil deflects water-drops, 
so that all of the water-drops in the frontal area view will not hit the surface.

Water-drop impingement quantification methods were developed to assess how many drops can hit where on a surface. 
Direct test methods involved the use of blotter paper to absorb water drops on a surface. 
Mathematical analysis of the paths individual water drops were developed. 
However, any method was involved and resource intensive. 
So, extensive libraries of water-drop impingement data for several airfoils and conditions were collected into design manuals. 

Other surfaces (non-airfoils) were also included (more than half of the publications in this category), 
as noted in the rest of the quote from above: 

_"As part of a comprehensive research program concerning the problem
of ice prevention on aircraft, an investigation of the impingement of
cloud droplets on airfoils, aerodynamic bodies, and other aircraft 
components has been undertaken by the NACA Lewis laboratory. The 
investigation includes a study of cloud-droplet impingement on low-drag airfoils
(refs. 1 to 3) and on cylinders (refs. 4 and 5). Previous investigators
have calculated the water-droplet trajectories for cylinders (refs. 6 to 9) 
and for Joukowski airfoils (refs. 10 and 11). 
For a complete appraisal of the problem of ice prevention on aircraft, 
further water-droplet impingement data are needed for aircraft components, 
including the curved sections or elbows in air-intake ducts."_  
[^1]  

The importance of this "investigation of the impingement" is shown by noting that of the 17 categories identified in 
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md), 
the largest category is "Impingement of Cloud Droplets" with 25 publications (out of 132 total publications). 

There were also important additional publications included below. 

## Discussion  

We have extensively reviewed the impingement of water drops in the [Icing on Cylinders thread]({filename}Icing%20on%20Cylinders.md), 
so that will not be repeated here. However, we are never far from cylinders in the NACA-era, 
so they will come up in some publications here.
