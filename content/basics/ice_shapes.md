## DRAFT

As ice accumulates on a wing, it changes the shape of the airfoil. 
The shape of the ice depends on details of the flight and icing conditions.  

At warmer temperatures (about -10C to 0C, depending on airspeed and other factors), 
ice shapes tend to produce "Glaze Ice" shapes with "horns". 
The nomenclature varies by domain. 
Pilot training materials generally note this type of ice as "Clear Ice".

At colder temperatures, the ice appears milky and opaque, and is termed "Rime Ice".

At temperatures in between, "Mixed Ice" can form.

These types of ice can have varying effects on lift and drag. 

The [FAA-H-8083-28]({filename}resources.md#FAA-H-8083-28), "Aviation Weather Handbook" says of clear or glaze 
ice can be the most hazardous form:

>__Clear icing is a more hazardous ice type for many reasons.__ 
It tends to form horns near the top and bottom of the airfoilsâ€™ 
leading edge, which greatly affects airflow. This results in 
an area of disrupted and turbulent airflow that is considerably 
larger than that caused by rime ice. Since it is clear and 
difficult to see, the pilot may not be able to quickly recognize 
that it is occurring. It can be difficult to remove since it can 
spread beyond the deicing or anti-icing equipment, although in 
most cases, it is removed nearly completely by deicing devices.

Ice shape can be related to the calculated freezing fraction
("relatively slow freezing"): 

>Clear ice (or glaze ice) is a glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large, 
supercooled water droplets. Clear icing conditions exist more often in an environment with warmer 
temperatures, higher liquid water contents, and larger droplets.

Calculations to relate ice shape to freezing fraction have many variables. 
Here is a figure that summarizes the effects of some variables
(n is calculated freezing fraction):

Note that at high enough airspeeds, there is a wide range of 
temperatures that are predicted to not result in ice 
(n = freezing fraction = 0).  

## Resources  

[The Aircraft Icing Handbook, DOT/FAA/CT-88/8](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf), 
Chapter 1, Section 2 in particular.  
Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf) The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.
