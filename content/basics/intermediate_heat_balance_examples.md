## Prerequisites  

To learn the energy terms and equations, readers should first review the 
["Standard Computational Model"]({filename}intermediate_merged_handbook.md#standard-computational-model), 
which combines the applicable sections original DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 and the update into one text. 
 
## Introduction  

The term "standard computational model" has not seen wide use. 
Most recent literature refers to the "Messinger Model" or "Modified Messinger Model". 
That may or may not mean the "standard computational model" presented here. 
As noted for calculating evaporation:  
>There are a variety of formulations of this term.  

That could also apply to several of the terms in the model. 
"Modified Messinger Model" could mean about anything, you would need to look at the details.  

The energy examples in the handbook are less detailed than the ones we previously saw for impingement. 

The "Standard Computational Model" is implemented here in the python programming language 
and is available via 
[github.com/icinganalysis](https://github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/tree/main/icinganalysis), 
file "table_2_5.py" (and associated files) for the solutions, 
under the [LGPL license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/main/LICENSE). 
Internally, the code uses (mostly) SI units 
(see [A Brief Digression on Unit Systems]({filename}..%2Fbrief-digression-on-units.md) for details). 
There are unit conversion functions in the python code. 
Values here are reported in the handbook units.

## Table 2-5 Example  

>Dependence of freezing fraction on meteorological and flight variables  
> 
>The dependence of the freezing fraction n on meteorological and flight variables in the standard
computational model will now be illustrated by calculations at the stagnation line of a circular cylinder
of diameter 20 cm. The calculations were done using a program that is a modification of the one
discussed in reference 2-44. This program uses the heat transfer coefficient correlation for a clean
cylinder from reference 2-45. If these calculations were done for a different geometry, or with a
different program, or using a different heat transfer coefficient correlation, the numerical values
would certainly change, but the general relationships illustrated would be much the same.
Two "baseline conditions" are specified:  

```text
          Ambient           Droplet  Freestream
          Temperature LWC   Diameter Velocity
Condition  C          g/m^3 um       Vinf (m/s)
a.        -26         0.7   20       70
b.         -6         0.1   20       70
```

>These were chosen because both have a freezing fraction of approximately .9 and both permit the
variation of each of the four parameters individually, driving the value of n toward 0.  
> 
>(It must be emphasized here that the following results indicate the magnitude of the freezing
fraction along the stagnation line only. The unfrozen water may run back (or "slide" back in the form
of large surface drops) from the stagnation line and eventually freeze somewhere on the cylinder.
This is discussed further in the next section.)  
> 
>Starting with condition (a), n was calculated for several increasing values of Tinf terminating with
-2 C (figure 2-75a) and then the same procedure was followed starting with condition (b), again
terminating with Tinf = -2 C (figure 2-75b). The figures illustrate that n decreases linearly with
increasing T. Note that figure 2-75a, with a relatively large LWC of .7 and starting from a low
temperature of -26 C, exhibits a much slower rate of decrease in n than does figure 2-75b, which
has a LWC of .1 and starts from a much higher temperature of -6 C.  

![Figure 2-75.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FFigure%202-75.png)  

>Table 2-5a shows the relative contributions to the energy balance of the main heat source and
heat sink terms for condition (a) as T increases. For the source terms, the relative contribution of
the droplet freezing term falls dramatically as the freezing fraction approaches 0 and this results in
a larger relative contribution of the aerodynamic heating term. For the sink terms, the contributions
are relatively constant. Table 2-5b for condition (b) shows that because LWC = .1 the relative
contribution of the droplet freezing term is smaller at all temperatures and the relative contribution
of the aerodynamic heating term is correspondingly larger. For the sink terms, the contributions are
again relatively constant.

## Reproducing the examples  

Figures 2-75 through 2-78 and Tables 2-5 through 2-8 show an example analysis 
for a 20 cm diameter cylinder in a range of icing conditions. 

(Other results tables and figures not included here.)

The examples are useful for showing general trends and relative percentages of energy. 

For comparison, I have implemented the 
"Standard Computational Model" in the python programming language.  

Not all analysis details were described. 
For example, an altitude or air pressure was not noted. 
I assumed a sea-level altitude. 
A drop size distribution was not defined. 
I assumed a "Langmuir A" distribution (single or mono-dispersed drop size). 

The method of determining the leading edge stagnation line water catch Î² value is not defined in the handbook text. 
For the calculations here, the cylinder line from Figure 2-43 is used.  

![Figure 2-43.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FFigure%202-43.png)  

Note that the characteristic length used to calculate Ko is the cylinder radius or diameter / 2.  

![Table 2-3.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FTable%202-3.png)

Equations 2-6, and 2-8 are used to calculate Ko.  

![Equation 2-6.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FEquation%202-6.png)  

![Equation 2-8.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FEquation%202-8.png)  

Note that equation 2-10 could also be used.  
 
![Equation 2-10.png](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FEquation%202-10.png)  

For the freezing fraction values, the comparison is "good", 
but the results from Table 2-8b (having higher airspeeds) have an offset.
The handbook values are "reference", and the values calculated with the python program are "calculated":  

![dot_faa_ct_88_8_1_cylinder_n.png](/images/basics/dot_faa_ct_88_8_1_cylinder_n.png)  

The percentages of the heat sources and sinks are similar, but not identical, to the values listed in the handbook ("reference"). 
Some cases, like 2-5-b at -2C, have some differences greater than 10%, 
but the freezing fractions were similar (0.10\0.13).

I also ran this with a Langmuir D distribution (not shown). 
The results were very similar. 

## Figure 2-81  

Figure 2-81 (and 2-82) show calculated cylinder stagnation line freezing fraction related to ice type:
glaze 0 < n < 0.66, intermediate 0.66 < n < 1, rime n = 1.

![Figure 2-81. Ice shpae types as a function of speed and ambient temperature for a liquid water content of 0. g/m^3.](..%2Fimages%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FFigure%202-81.png)  

The Python implementation of the Standard Computational Model was also used to reproduce Figure 2-81.  

The method of determining the leading edge stagnation line water catch Î² value is not defined in the handbook text. 
For the calculations here, the cylinder line from Figure 2-43 is used.  

A Langmuir A drop size distribution was assumed. 
The values are similar, but not identical, to Figure 2-81.

## Conclusions  

I view this as a representative implementation of the Standard Computational Model. 
However, after we have tried this example using LEWICE, there will be further discussion.
