## DRAFT

Aircraft designs for flight in icing are improved and proven effective by several tools, 
including analysis, icing wind tunnel test, and flight test in icing conditions. 

Design handbooks have charts and tables that can be used to perform analyses for 
aircraft icing and ice protection. 

There are computerized icing analysis tools available from NASA, and from commercial vendors. 
There is also "bespoke" software created for special purposes. 

Wind tunnels are used to study many effects on aircraft, including icing. 
Artificially produced ice shapes (often 3D printed) may be adhered to airplane models, and the effects studied. 

Icing wind tunnels can produce ice shapes simulating those that may form in flight. 

Flight tests are used to determine that ice protection systems operate as intended. 
Flight tests may be conducted using artificial ice shapes.

As a final proof that everything works as intended, flight tests in natural icing conditions are conducted.
