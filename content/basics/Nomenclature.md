## DRAFT  

## Introduction  

These terms are taken largely from [ADS-4]({filename}resources.md#ADS4), with updates and additions. 
See the [Resources]({filename}resources.md#terminology) for other, more extensive terms lists.

## Selected Aircraft Icing Terms  

__Airfoil chord__: the longest line possible between the leading edge and trailing edge of an airfoil. 

<a name="airspeed">__Airspeed__</a>: The speed of the aircraft through the air. Sometimes measured in knots (nautical mile per hour) or KTAS. 
A nautical mile is about 6076 feet or 1852 m, or 1.15 statute ("standard") miles. 
  
<a name="angle-of-attack">__Angle of attack__</a>: Angle between airfoil chord and line of flight.  
  
<a name="anti-icing">__Anti-icing__</a>: The prevention of ice formation on airframe surfaces. The use of heat is the most common means of anti-icing.  
  
<a name="appendix-c">__Appendix C__</a>: Appendix C of the United States Chapter 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 
that defines icing conditions used for certification of large transport category aircraft.  
  
<a name="appendix-o">__Appendix O__</a>: Appendix O of the United States Chapter 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 
that defines large drop icing conditions used for certification of large transport category aircraft. 
It defines conditions for freezing drizzle and freezing rain.  
  
<a name="collection-efficiency">__Collection efficiency__</a>: The ratio of actual water collection rate to the water
catch rate when water drop paths are straight lines. Also termed catch efficiency.   
  
<a name="continuous-max">__Continuous Maximum Icing__</a>: Icing category defined in Appendix C for "Stratiform Clouds", commonly used for 
design of wing, empennage, and windshield ice protection on transport 
aircraft.  
  
<a name="cumulus">__Cumulus clouds__</a>: Massy, piled-up clouds with a flat base.  
  
<a name="deicing">__De-icing__</a>: The removal of ice that has formed on airframe surfaces.

<a name="drop-trajectory">__Drop trajectory__</a>: The path of a water drop with respect to an airfoil.  

<a name="evaporation">__Evaporation__</a>: The process where liquid water turns to water vapor.  

<a name="freezing-drizzle">__Freezing Drizzle__</a>: Drizzle size water drops at temperature slightly below freezing and characterized
by relatively large water drops that may freeze in contact with airframe surfaces.  

<a name="freezing-fraction">__Freezing fraction__</a>: That part of the water catch that freezes.  

<a name="freezing-rain">__Freezing rain__</a>: Rain at temperature slightly below freezing and characterized
by relatively large water drops that may freeze in contact with airframe
surfaces.  

<a name="glaze-ice">__Glaze ice__</a>: Clear ice with rapid growth rate and characteristic "double horn"
or "mushroom" formation. (This term is also used by pilots to describe a
smooth film of ice covering leading edges at temperatures just below
the melting point of ice.)  

<a name="ice-accretion">__Ice accretion__</a>: A growth or buildup of ice; an ice formation. 

<a name="icing-wind-tunnel">__Icing wind tunnel__</a>: A wind tunnel (a tube with a fan to provide airflow) that also has a means of 
providing cold air and water spray to simulate supercooled cloud icing conditions. 

<a name="impingement-limits">__Impingement limits__</a>: The end of the water impingement region on both upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil.  

<a name="intermittent-max">__Intermittent maximum icing__</a>: Icing category defined in Appendix C, based on cumuliform
clouds having high liquid water content for short times.  

<a name="langmuir-distribution">__Langmuir drop size distribution__</a>: A seven-bin drop size distribution defining at representative drop size for each bin, 
and a fraction of the total water content of a cloud, something like a normal or "bell" curve. Named after Iring Langmuir, 
who proposed several distributions circa 1945.  

<a name="latent-heat">__Latent heat__</a>: The exchange of heat required for water to change from liquid to solid ice 
(latent heat of fusion or freezing), or from liquid to vapor (latent heat of evaporation). 

<a name="liquid-water-content">__Liquid water content__<a/>: Water contained as free moisture in a volume of air
(does not include water in vapor form). Typically measured in g/m^3 (grams per cubic meter). 

__Local collection rate__: Mass of impinging water per unit time and per unit
area at a given location.  

<a name="medd">__Mean effective drop diameter (MED)__</a>: Half the volume of water in a given sample
of air is contained in larger drops, half in smaller drops. 
Functionally interchangeable with MVD.  

<a name="mixed-ice">__Mixed Ice__</a>: Simultaneous appearance of rime and clear ice or an ice formation that has
the characteristics of both rime and glaze (or clear) ice.  
  
<a name="mvd">__Median volumetric diameter (MVD)__</a>: drop diameter defined by the condition
that half the volume of water in a given sample of air is contained in large
drops, half in small drops. Functionally interchangeable with MED.  

__Melting point of ice__: The temperature at which ice melts at normal pressures, 0°C or 32°F. 
Sometimes termed "freezing point", but that does not account for supercooled liquid water.  

<a name="messinger">__Messinger heat balance__</a>: A thermodynamic model of the freezing of water. 
Named after Bernard Messinger, who published it circa 1951.
  
<a name="micrometer">__Micrometer__</a> (μm): One millionth of a meter. Sometimes called "micron" in older literature.  
  
<a name="rime-ice">__Rime ice__</a>: Milky white, low-density ice formed at low temperatures with a
relatively streamlined shape; also referred to as spearhead and knife-edge
ice.  
  
<a name="runback-ice">__Runback ice__</a>: Ice accumulated aft of the protected region, resulting from the
water running back area freezing (may be found with partially evaporative
anti-icing systems and with de-icing systems).  
  
<a name="running-wet">__Running wet__</a>: A condition at which an airframe surface is maintained above
32°F (by a heating anti-icing system) so that impinging water drops will not
freeze.  
  
<a name="stratus">__Stratus clouds__</a>: Layer-type clouds, usually at low altitudes. Also termed "Stratiform".  
  
<a name="supercooled">__Supercooled water drops__</a>: Small water drops suspended in the air at
temperatures below the melting point of ice (0°C or 32°F).  
  
<a name="water-catch">__Water catch__</a>: The mass of water impinging on an airframe surface (per unit
length of span and per unit time for an airfoil).  
  
<a name="vapor">__Water vapor__</a>: The gaseous state of water.
