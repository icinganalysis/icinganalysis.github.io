## Introduction  

The good news is that these comprise thousands of pages of reading. 
The bad news is that these comprise thousands of pages of reading. 

A few experts that I know have confessed that they have not read all of 
what I consider to be "The Big Three", let alone everything listed here. 
So, you can probably get by not reading everything here. 

Most of the resources are online and available at no cost. 
Some are copyrighted, and available for purchase or online access rental. 
Your local library can get most of them for you through inter-library loan. 

## The Big Three  

These total to over 800 pages (over 1200 if one counts all three volumes of DOT/FAA/CT-88/8), 
but they can give you broad exposure to aircraft icing technology. 
However, they are now a little dated (the most recent, DOT/FAA/CT-88/8, was updated in 1993).  

If I had to pick only one, it would be DOT/FAA/CT-88/8.  

[Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data, ADS-4](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0608865)  

[Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection, AIR1168/4](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air1168/4/)  

[The Aircraft Icing Handbook, DOT/FAA/CT-88/8](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf)  
Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf)  
The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.  

## History

["We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162)

["Bringing the Future Within Reach: the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center"](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-2016-627.pdf)  

"The Wind and Beyond: Journey into the History of Aerodynamics in America, Volume 2, Reinventing the Airplane.", NASA-SP-4409, 2007.

## Aviation Weather and Icing   

[Aviation Weather Handbook, FAA-H-8083-28](https://www.faa.gov/regulationspolicies/handbooksmanuals/aviation/faa-h-8083-28-aviation-weather-handbook)  
Chapter 20 covers icing. This consolidates some prior publications:    
```text
This handbook consolidates the weather information from the following 
advisory circulars (AC) into one source document. By doing this, 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to streamline access
to the FAA’s weather documentation for users of the National Airspace 
System (NAS). The following ACs will remain in effect, but they will 
eventually be cancelled at a later date following the publication of this
handbook:
• AC 00-6, Aviation Weather.
• AC 00-24, Thunderstorms.
• AC 00-30, Clear Air Turbulence Avoidance.
• AC 00-45, Aviation Weather Services.
• AC 00-54, Pilot Windshear Guide.
• AC 00-57, Hazardous Mountain Winds.
```

## Design Guides  

See the "Big Three above"  

Also see the post on [Design Manuals]({filename}..%2FDesign%20Manuals.md), 
and the [SAE AC-9C](http://profiles.sae.org/teaac9c/) documents below.  

## Icing regulations  

[Appendix C](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25/appendix-Appendix%20C%20to%20Part%2025)

[Appendix O](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25/subpart-F/subject-group-ECFR3f07132c2c2d01e/section-25.1420)  

## SAE AC-9C 

The Aircraft Icing Technology Technical Committee publishes Aerospace Information Reports, 
Aerospace Recommended Practices, and Aerospace Standards [SAE AC-9C](http://profiles.sae.org/teaac9c/).  

## Advisory Circulars (AC)  

While you may not be involved in aircraft certification, these can be more general aircraft icing resources. 

["Aircraft Ice Protection," AC 20-73A](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-73A.pdf)  
The "APPENDIX B. NOMENCLATURE" section is particularly useful. 
 
[Pilot Guide: Flight in Icing Conditions, AC 91-74B](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91-74B.pdf)  

Also see "Aviation Weather Handbook, FAA-H-8083-28" further above. 

## Icing Wind Tunnel Test  

As noted in the post [Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread](https://icinganalysis.com/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html), 
for icing wind tunnels, unlike regular wind tunnels, there is no comprehensive source of information for their use. 

[NASA/CR-2004-212875 "Manual of Scaling Methods"](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040042486) 
has much information on scaling test conditions, 
and some more general information.  
 
Some SAE documents provide information on the calibration of icing wind tunnels.   

- [Calibration and Acceptance of Icing Wind Tunnels ARP5905](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp5905a/)  
- [Icing Wind Tunnel Interfacility Comparison Tests(STABILIZED Oct 2018) AIR5666A](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air5666a/)  

## [The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications](https://icinganalysis.com/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html)  

132 NACA icing publications in 16 categories that are still relevant today. 

## NASA  

[NASA Glenn Beginners Guide to Aeronautics: Guide to Aerodynamics](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/learn-about-aerodynamics/)  
A rather good review for anyone, not just beginners. 

The [NTRS - NASA Technical Reports Server](https://ntrs.nasa.gov) has nearly all NASA (and NACA!) publications available. 

## Courses  

The [NASA Aircraft Icing Training](https://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/) 
is focussed on pilots needs. 

[University of Kansas: Aircraft Icing: Meteorology, Protective Systems, Instrumentation and Certification](https://www.enrole.com/kupce/jsp/course.jsp?categoryId=&courseId=AERO0060)  
This five-day course is periodically offered at geographically diverse sites. 

Some commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages that include icing simulation capabilities offer training.   

## Terminology  

There are lists of terminology available in addition to ADS-4 and DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 listed above. 

[NASA Aircraft Icing Training: Glossary](https://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/documents/AircraftIcing_Glossary.pdf)  

["Aircraft Ice Protection," AC 20-73A](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-73A.pdf)  
The "APPENDIX B. NOMENCLATURE" section is particularly useful. 

[SAE ARP5624, Aircraft Inflight Icing Terminology](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp5624/)  
The "APPENDIX A - DISCUSSION OF ICING INTENSITY TERMS DEFINITIONS" is especially recommended.  

## More Recent Publications  

Much has been published since the DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 Aircraft Icing Handbook, 
of which Volume III includes an extensive bibliography. 
Publishing an extensive bibliography now would be impractical (on this or almost any topic), 
given the current pace of new information. 

Online searches may be the best solution in these times. 
Once you are grounded in the basics, 
you will know the terminology and be able to better shape you search inquiries.
