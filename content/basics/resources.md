## Introduction  

The good news is that these comprise thousands of pages of reading.  
The bad news is that these comprise thousands of pages of reading. 

A few experts that I know have confessed that they have not read all of 
what I consider to be "The Big Three", let alone everything listed here. 
So, you can probably get along by not reading everything. 

Most of the resources are online and available at no cost. 
Some are copyrighted, and available for purchase or online access rental. 
Your local library can get most of them for you through inter-library loan. 

## The Big Three {: #ADS4 }  

These total to over 800 pages (over 1200 if one counts all three volumes of DOT/FAA/CT-88/8), 
but they can give you broad exposure to aircraft icing technology. 
However, they are now a little dated (the most recent, DOT/FAA/CT-88/8, was updated in 1993).  

If I had to pick only one, it would be DOT/FAA/CT-88/8.  

- "Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data", ADS-4 [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0608865)  

- "Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection", AIR1168/4 [sae.org](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air1168/4/)  

- The "Aircraft Icing Handbook"," DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf)  
Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf)  
The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.  
Also note that there are 3 volumes:  
"Aircraft Icing Handbook Volume 2", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-2. [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238040.pdf)  
"Aircraft Icing Handbook Volume 3", DOT/FAA/C-88/8-3. [apps.dtic.mil](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA2380410)  
Some pages in Volume 3 are affected by the update noted above.

## Advisory Circulars (AC)  

While you may not be involved in aircraft certification, these can be more general aircraft icing resources. 

"Aircraft Ice Protection," AC 20-73A [faa.gov](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-73A.pdf)  
The "APPENDIX B. NOMENCLATURE" section is particularly useful.

Chapter 20 covers icing. This consolidates some prior publications:    
```text
This handbook consolidates the weather information from the following 
advisory circulars (AC) into one source document. By doing this, 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to streamline access
to the FAA’s weather documentation for users of the National Airspace 
System (NAS). The following ACs will remain in effect, but they will 
eventually be cancelled at a later date following the publication of this
handbook:
• AC 00-6, Aviation Weather.
• AC 00-24, Thunderstorms.
• AC 00-30, Clear Air Turbulence Avoidance.
• AC 00-45, Aviation Weather Services.
• AC 00-54, Pilot Windshear Guide.
• AC 00-57, Hazardous Mountain Winds.

## Icing Wind Tunnel Test {: #icing-wind-tunnel }  

As noted in the post [Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread](https://icinganalysis.com/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html), 
for icing wind tunnels, unlike regular wind tunnels, there is no comprehensive source of information for their use. 

NASA/CR-2004-212875 "Manual of Scaling Methods" [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20040042486)  
has much information on scaling test conditions, 
and some more general information.  

The NASA Icing Research [wind] Tunnel (IRT) [www1.grc.nasa.gov](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/irt/)  

<a name="sae-icing-tunnel"></a> 

Some SAE documents provide information on the calibration of icing wind tunnels.

A rather good review for anyone, not just beginners. 

The NTRS - NASA Technical Reports Server [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov) has nearly all NASA (and NACA!) publications available. 

The NASA-provided Icing Research Software (LEWICE, LEWICE 3D) [www1.grc.nasa.gov](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/aeronautics/icing/software/)  

The NASA Icing Research [wind] Tunnel (IRT) [www1.grc.nasa.gov](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/irt/)  

"Airframe and Engine Icing" [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190025413)    
> This is both a presented version of NASA's in-flight icing training aids, and a brief discussion of NASA Glenn's two icing-capable facilities that simulate the airframe and engine icing environments.  

"Introduction to Aircraft Icing and NASA's Approach to Understanding It" [ntrs.nasa.gov](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014029)  
>This presentation provides an introduction to aircraft icing and describes NASA’s approach to understanding it. The presentation covers various topics on icing. A general overview of different types of icing is provided, which includes airframe icing, jet engine icing, and rotorcraft icing. The presentation discusses NASA’s approach to studying the various forms of aircraft icing, which includes conducting flight tests, performing ground-based icing wind tunnel tests, and developing computational tools that simulate the icing physics. An overview on the future of aviation and icing is provided. The presentation is largely high level, but also provides some technical icing physics discussion.  

## Weather  

[aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov/gfa/#gairmet)  
Live feed of weather information, see "AIRMETS" that can include icing conditions, as well as other current weather data.  

"Icing" [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/icing_stuff/icing/icing.htm)  
>Icing, in general, is any deposit or coating of ice on an object, caused by the impingement and freezing of liquid (usually supercooled) hydrometeors; to be distinguished from hoarfrost in that the latter results from the deposition of water vapor.  


## Courses  

"ALC-33: Inflight Icing" [faasafety.gov](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/course_content.aspx?enroll=true&cID=33)  
>Despite improvements in equipment and forecast technique, inflight icing is a contributing factor in accidents and incidents each year.  What are the reasons for these encounters, and what can you as a pilot do to safely manage the risk associated with icing?  
>In this course you will learn that water does not always freeze at 32° F. or 0° C. You’ll discover which temperatures are most conducive to clear, rime, and mixed icing, and how water content and droplet size relates to icing severity. You may discover that the de-ice or anti-ice equipment on your aircraft cannot always provide adequate protection. You will find tools for evaluating icing conditions before flight, and you'll have the opportunity to understand and learn how to avoid or, if necessary, recover from roll upset and tail stalls caused by structural ice.  

The NASA Aircraft Icing Training [aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov](https://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/) 
>A course primarily intended for pilots who fly aircraft certified for flight into icing. With an operational focus, this course provides tools pilots can use to deal with in-flight icing.   

University of Kansas: Aircraft Icing: Meteorology, Protective Systems, Instrumentation and Certification [enrole.com](https://www.enrole.com/kupce/jsp/course.jsp?categoryId=&courseId=AERO0060)  
>This course covers the meteorology and physics of aircraft icing. Topics include forecasting, finding and avoiding icing conditions, designing and evaluating ice protection systems, and certification of aircraft for flight into known icing conditions.   

Some commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages that include icing simulation capabilities offer training.   

## Terminology  {: #terminology }  

There are lists of terminology available in addition to ADS-4 and DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 listed above. 

NASA Aircraft Icing Training: Glossary [aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov](https://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/documents/AircraftIcing_Glossary.pdf)  

"Aircraft Ice Protection," AC 20-73A [faa.gov](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-73A.pdf)  
The "APPENDIX B. NOMENCLATURE" section is particularly useful. 

SAE ARP5624, Aircraft Inflight Icing Terminology [sae.org](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/arp5624/) [Payment or institutional access required]  
The "APPENDIX A - DISCUSSION OF ICING INTENSITY TERMS DEFINITIONS" is especially recommended.  

## More Recent Publications  

Much has been published since the DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 Aircraft Icing Handbook, 
of which Volume III includes an extensive bibliography. 
Publishing an extensive bibliography now would be impractical (on this or almost any topic), 
given the current pace of new information. 

Online searches may be the best solution in these times. 
Once you are grounded in the basics, 
you will know the terminology and be able to better shape you search inquiries.
