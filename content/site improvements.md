## Summary  

Since I started ["Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications"]({filename}introduction.md) 
20 months ago, I have made over 100 posts. 
I have extensively revised some, and made improvements to all of them, so it is time to repost them. 

I will be posting links and short summaries to them in the original sequence on mastodon [historians.social/@icinganalysis](https://historians.social/@icinganalysis) 
at a rate of three per week (about the pace that I originally posted them), so it will take almost a year to cycle through them. 
And I do plan on also creating new posts.  

If you want to read at you own pace, you can go to the [Latest Posts](/archives.html) 
tab at the top of the page for the complete list of posts. 

And there is now a link if you use [RSS](/feeds/all.rss.xml).
