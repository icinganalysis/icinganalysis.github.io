##Summary  
The effect of drop size distribution correlations for water drop impingement on a cylinder from 
is implemented in the Python programming language. 

##Discussion

"Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories" [^1] provides definitions for assumed water drop size distributions. 
Those distributions were used to calculated the water impingement efficiency on a cylinder. 

The differences in impingement efficiencies (Em) were summarized in Table XI for the water drop size distributions (A, B, C, D, E).

The K value for the distributions is calculated at the "volume-mean" drop diameter.

The ["Implementation of cylinder impingement correlations in Python"]({filename}Implementation of cylinder impingement correlations in Python.md) 
was updated to include the drop size definitions from Table IX. 

Values calculated with the updated Python tool compare well to the Table XI values:

The E distribution tends to give the lowest Em value at low values of 1/K,
and the highest Em values at high values of 1/K](/images/calculation_verification_table_XI_k_phi=10000.png)

The choice of 1/K for the X axis was deliberate, as 1/K is proportional to cylinder diameter or radius C. 
The Y axis Em is proportional to experimentally measured ice mass on a cylinder.
 
> A curve was prepared in which Em was plotted against 1/K on double logarithmic paper for a constant value of Κφ which was taken to be 10000.

>The experimental data are compared with the theoretical curve by superimposing one
sheet on the other, sliding the upper sheet (with the axis of coordinates parallel
for the two sheets) until the two curves coincide at the end where C is small.

So here is the log-log version of the calculation:
