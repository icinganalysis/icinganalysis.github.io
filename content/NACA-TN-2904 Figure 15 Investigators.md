## NACA-TN-2094 and investigators operating the water-drop-trajectory analog  

![Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904. Water-drop-trajectory analog.
Two investigators operate a large mechanical computer. 
One is seated turning a crank attached to a large cylinder labelled "Input Chart". 
The second operator turns another input chart crank. 
Another cylinder is labelled "Droplet Trajectories". 
There are many shafts and gears visible in the machine. 
Some machine parts are labelled with the differential equations of motion being solved.

## Summary  

While no one is identified in Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904, 
I speculate that these investigators are 
Helen M. Gallagher, and Dorothea E. Vogt. 
(I do not know which name goes with which individual). 
While neither Gallager nor Vogt is credited in NACA-TN-2904, 
it is possible that they contributed to the analysis, 
as they did in several other water-drop trajectory publications. 

## Discussion  

Yes, I have used this figure a lot, as it is one of the best of the hundreds I have viewed from the NACA-era. 
This image is also notable in that of the hundreds of NACA-era documents that I have read, 
this is the only one where the people appear to be women. 

I have not been able to find photos of Gallager or Vogt for comparison
(and photos of any NACA-era authors are hard to find). 
In this photo the individuals are not at good angles for identification anyway. 

The rationale for the identification is that Gallager or Vogt collaborated on other publications with Rinaldo Brun as lead author.  
The publications are before and after NACA-TN-2904.  

Selected publications with Brun as lead author:  

- Brun, Rinaldo J., Gallagher, Helen M., and Vogt, Dorothea E.: Impingement of Water Droplets on NACA 651-208 and 651-212 Airfoils at 4째 Angle of Attack. NACA-TN-2952, 1953.  
- Brun, Rinaldo J., and Mergler, Harry W.: Impingement of Water Droplets on a Cylinder in an Incompressible Flow Field and Evaluation of Rotating Multicylinder Method for Measurement of Droplet-Size Distribution, Volume-Median Droplet Size, and Liquid-Water Content in Clouds. NACA-TN-2904, 1953.

- Brun, Rinaldo J., Gallagher, Helen M., and Vogt, Dorothea E.: Impingement of Water Droplets on NACA 65A004 Airfoil at 8째 Angle of Attack. NACA-TN-3155, 1954.  
- Brun, Rinaldo J., and Vogt, Dorothea E.: Impingement of Water Droplets on NACA 65A004 Airfoil at 0째 Angle of Attack. NACA-TN-3586, 1955.  

I have not found biographies of either investigator. 
Here are listings from worldcat.org of their publications 
(the listings on ntrs.nasa.gov are incomplete for these authors).

## Update  

A relative of Hellen Gallagher confirmed that the woman on the left is her. 

S. from Ohio emailed:

>The woman on the left is Helen Marie Gallagher (Madden), my Mom. I believe they were doing research for what would become the F-14 fighter.  
>I found your site while doing a Google search for her - it was a nice surprise to see this photo and your recognition of her and her coworkers. Thank you!  
>She met my Dad while working at NACA - they got married in 1954. They had eight children together, seven boys and one girl. Helen Marie was an awesome Mom and person.  
>Thanks again for recognizing her.
