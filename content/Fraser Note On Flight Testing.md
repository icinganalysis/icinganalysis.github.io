# Lecture No. 12b, NOTE ON THE FLIGHT TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF ICING PROTECTION SYSTEMS  

## Summary  

An alternative view of how to correlate icing conditions to ice protection performance.  

## Key Points  

1. The concepts of protection system "failure" vs. "deficiency" are discussed. 
2. Diagrams characterize the rate of water catch vs. extent in icing as a key parameter for ice protection.  
3. Test conditions specifically planned to find the point of failure or deficiency are recommended.  

## Abstract  

> Flight tests of an icing protection system consist of functioning tests, 
tests to determine the internal efficiencies, and tests of the performance in icing. 
The performance in icing can be determined 
only if the appropriate measurements are made, 
and if the flow of protection or the icing severity can be adjusted. 
The results can be reduced to standard conditions, using theoretical corrections, 
and can be plotted on a diagram to show whether performance meets design requirements, 
or to assess the degree of protection afforded by the ultimate, 
or any lower, performance. 

## Discussion  

This publication addresses several modes of ice protection. 
For brevity, I will detail the sections about fluid protection systems only. 
There are interesting comments on thermal anti-ice and deicing 
that the reader may wish to find in the full publication. 

### 1.0 INTRODUCTION  

>Tests to determine the performance of an icing protection system 
are like those to determine the performance, stability or control of an aircraft, 
in that they are of little value, or can even be misleading, 
unless they can be subjected to an analytical treatment, 
and reduced to a generalised form which is applicable to conditions 
other than those under which the tests were actually made. 
Particularly in the case of icing trials, 
it is quite impractical to cover or obtain the range of conditions 
necessary for sound empirical data. 
The purpose of this paper is to indicate (not to demonstrate) 
a procedure for performing icing trials 
and reducing the results to give a practical answer. 
The procedure outlined presumes that sufficient preliminary analysis 
and tests have been made for the basic characteristics 
of the protective system to be understood, 
and to be expressible in a theoretical form. 
It also presumes an ability to measure cloud properties, 
and for the purpose of assessing the results, 
depends on the availability of a representative collection of statistical icing data. 

### 2.0 TEST PROCEDURE  

> The procedure for testing an anti-icing or de-icing system in an aircraft 
breaks down into three phases 
> 
> 2.01 Functioning tests to establish the correct design, manufacture and assembly of the system, without reference to its behaviour in icing.  
> 2.02 Tests to determine the internal performance of the system so that efficiencies can be established.  
> 2.03 Tests to determine the performance of the system in icing, under either simulated or natural conditions, or both.  

### 2.1 Functioning Tests  

> Functioning tests should be quite straightforward, 
except for technical difficulties which may be involved in, 
for example, establishing satisfactory alcohol spray distribution 
in an engine intake for a variety of engine and flight conditions, 
or measuring the appropriate temperatures in a thermal system. 
> 
> These tests will be quite specific to each system, 
and cannot be enumerated here, 
although some mention should be made of the wide field which must be covered. 
Electrothermal heater pads have to be considered 
for erosion and abrasion characteristics, chemical methods for corrosion, 
hot-air systems for excessive structural temperatures, 
mechanical shedding systems for their effect on the drag 
and stalling behaviour of the aircraft, and so on. 

### 2.2 Performance Tests  

> 2.2.1 Internal Performance  
> 
> The main purpose of these tests is to establish the efficiency of the system.  
> 
> For __thermal anti-icing__ it is necessary to determine the heat transfer coefficients 
at the various heat exchangers, 
and to find the proportion and distribution of the heat 
which eventually appears at the protected surfaces. 
This can only be done properly by flight tests to obtain 
the correct aerodynamic heat transfer condition, 
and should be done in cloud as well as in clear air 
to allow for changes in the transition point 
due to the wetting effect of the cloud, 
about which little appears to be known. 
Fortunately, with metal wings 
the basic measurement of external surface temperatures is not unduly troublesome.  
> 
> __Thermal de-icing__ systems are much more formidable 
because of the transient nature of the heat flows, 
and because of the technical difficulties 
of measuring surface temperatures in heater pads 
which have relatively steep thermal gradients. 
However, as the thermal characteristics of de-icing systems 
are profoundly modified by the presence of ice 
it is hard or impossible to establish any efficiencies in non-icing conditions, 
except for continuously-heated areas such as parting and dividing strips.  
> 
> __Freezing-point depressant__ systems have to be calibrated 
mainly in terms of the distribution of the liquid, 
the efficiency being measured as a distribution factor 
which will vary with flight conditions. 
The internal performance tests thus become integral with the functioning tests.  
> 
> The author is not sufficiently familiar with the quantitative behaviour 
of mechanical shedding systems to comment on their efficiency measurements.  
> 
> 2.2.2 Performance in Icing  
> 
> The only flight tests which can have any value are those 
in which a correlation can be established 
between the severity of the icing conditions 
and the rate at which icing protection is supplied. 
This correlation can be established satisfactorily 
at points where the rate of protection is just sufficient 
for the ambient icing conditions.  
> 
> It is first absolutely necessary to have suitable instrumentation 
to measure air temperature, liquid water content, and, if practicable, 
droplet-size and distribution, whether the icing is simulated or natural. 
Due to the rapid variations in many natural icing conditions, 
these instruments should give at least a semi-continuous reading. 
Suitable test instrumentation for this purpose, is, in general, available. 
If a fixed-rate protective system is used, 
it can only be tested by varying the icing conditions 
till a deficiency or failure* becomes apparent. 
This implies the use of simulated icing conditions, 
with the attendant difficulties of simulation and operation, 
or else an indefinitely prolonged programme 
of seeking natural icing conditions of the right degree of severity. 
Thus, even if it is the intention to use a fixed-rate system in production, 
it is worth modifying the test installation to give a controllable rate.

>> 
>> 5.0 PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS  
>> 
>> Before considering how these requirements should be applied 
to various protective systems and aircraft components, 
it is necessary to discuss the performance and failure or deficiency characteristics 
of each system. 
In normal engineering parlance, failure is a fairly definite condition, 
from which there is no recovery. 
Therefore when using the word in connection with an icing protection system 
it should signify that the system has ceased to be effective 
for the remainder of the icing encounter. 
Owing to the variety of behaviour of various systems, 
it is necessary to define failure for each system.  
>> 
>> However, protection may cease to be effective for a while in severe icing conditions 
and then recover completely or partially when the icing severity is reduced. 
In such a case the system could be called "deficient".  
The following examples contain mention of the performance, failure, 
and deficiency characteristics of various systems applied to various components. 
It will be seen that in all cases, deficiency or failure may be difficult to define, 
except perhaps through some secondary effect. 
>> 
>> 5.2 Freezing-point Depressant   
>> 
>> When a depressant is used as a pure anti-icing system 
as in the case of an alcohol spray, 
the system is found to be about equally sensitive to rate-of-catch 
and air temperature. 
This is probably equally true when the system is applied to de-icing, as on wings. 
Again, this system becomes deficient when ice starts to form, 
but this ice will be mushy and will blow off easily, 
so that deficiency can only be defined by a secondary effect 
such as a given increase of drag on a wing or loss of thrust in an engine. 
Recovery will occur in reduced conditions by melting or shedding of the ice, 
but a secondary effect, 
such as the damage to an engine, may result in virtual failure before recovery.  

> 
> If automatic metering controls are installed, 
it will obviously be necessary to make some preliminary 
flight trials to adjust these to give optimum performance,
which means that, to the best of their ability, they will supply just enough flow 
of protection to meet the ambient severity of icing. Thereafter, they should be used 
to control the rate of protection, both because they are likely to be more accurate 
than visual observation and manual control, and because the tests will generally 
be designed as trials of the combined protection and control system.  
Tests observations will consist of measurements of the rates of protection 
and of the corresponding meteorological conditions, 
together with general observations of the anti-icing or de-icing behaviour 
at various speeds and altitudes. For most systems the test have to be done 
in actual icing conditions, 
but for "dry" or evaporative anti-icing it is possible to operate in any type of cloud, 
except that observations of signs of deficiency are easier in icing cloud, 
and the effects of deficiency can be observed only in icing conditions. 
(When tests are made in warm cloud, the liquid water content instruments 
cannot be of the ice-accretion type. )  

### 2.3 Observations of Deficiency and Recovery  

> It should also be possible to obtain both qualitative and quantitative observations 
of the effects of a deficiency, by which is meant an inability to perform 
the anti-icing or de-icing functions completely, and of the ability of the system 
to recover from a condition of deficiency. This is of considerable importance 
in the assessment of the protective system, since it enables a decision 
as to whether short periods of deficiency can be tolerated. 
Observations can be obtained by reducing the flow of protection 
below that required in the test conditions.  

### 3.0 REDUCTION OF RESULTS  

### 3.1 EmV-theta Diagram  

> For each encounter for which reasonably steady readings were obtained, 
the rate-of-catch, EmV, must be calculated for each component under consideration, 
from the values of water content and droplet sizes measured. 
The measured rates of protection (or flows) are then plotted on EmV-theta 
diagrams as shown by the example in Fig. 1, 
on which the theoretical curves are also plotted. 
As it is not possible to make use of dimensionless parameters, 
there will be different EmV-theta diagrams for different selected altitudes and speeds. 
The test results can be corrected to the nearest selected speed and altitude, 
for small deviations, by applying the necessary theoretical corrections 
to the kinetic heating, evaporative loss and other relevant terms.

"m" is liquid water content, theta is ambient air temperature.](images%2FFraser%20Flight%2FFig1.jpg)  

> It is quite probable that the test results will not agree exactly with the theoretical 
flow curves, not only because of errors in measurement but also because of faults 
in the assumptions and constants used to derive the theoretical results. If this is the case, 
the flow performance curves will have to be adjusted to match the test results.  

### 3.2 m-theta Diagram  


>The adjusted flow curves are then transferred to m-theta co-ordinates by using 
the appropriate values of V and E: E being calculated 
for a standard droplet-size and distribution. 
>
>If it is necessary to show compliance with design requirements, 
the latter can also be shown on the m-theta diagram, as on Fig. 2, 
from which it is possible to see the amount by which the performance fails 
to meet or exceeds the design requirement.  

![Figure 2. Basic Distribution Diagram. Proposed maximum average water content for 
a given extent of icing. "E" is extent of icing, miles.](images%2FFraser%20Flight%2FFig2.jpg)  

>If, on the other hand, it is not necessary to meet specific requirements, 
but to determine the degree of protection, 
then the flow curves are shown on an m-theta scatterplot of all the relevant 
icing encounter measurements, as in Fig. 3. The relevancy of the measured data 
will be a matter for particular judgment. If required, 
the points may be restricted to measurements of a given duration, 
or for a given altitude band, or a given synoptic meteorological situation, 
or a geographical region, depending on the operational function 
of the aircraft and the availability of the necessary meteorological data.  

### 4.0 ASSESSMENT OF DEGREE OF PROTECTION 

> Suppose Fig. 2 shows the adjusted performance curves for an aircraft component 
for the worst conditions of speed and altitude. It wiLl be seen that the 
maximum flow of protection is sufficient for 1012 of a total of 1018 recorded icing situation, 
and 75% of the maximum flow would deal with 983. The degree of protection afforded 
on that component could then be assessed as 99% for maximum flow, and 97% for 75% of maximum flow.  
> 
> The various other components of the aircraft would be treated in a similar fashion, 
and thus the lowest degree of protection for the whole aircraft could be obtained.  
> 
> The results of such an assessment can be used to decide on modifications the protective system, 
or to set operational limitations on the aircraft, 
or for fairly direct comparison with other aircraft and other systems of protection.  

### 5.0 CONCLUSIONS  

> 5.1 Icing protection performance tests cannot be interpreted unless  
(a) Measurements are made of the meteorological conditions encountered on the tests  
(b) The flow of icing protection can be adjusted to be just adequate for the conditions 
encountered, or, conversely, icing conditions can be adjusted, by simulation, 
to suit the rate of protection   
(c) The flow of icing protection can be measured  
(d) The performance characteristics or the protective system are understood and known.   
5.2 If these conditions are met, it should be possible to extrapolate from the results 
of a few icing encounters to obtain the ultimate performance of the system.  
> 
> 5.3 It should also be possible to obtain a quantitative assessment of the degree of 
protection afforded by the ultimate, or any lower, performance of a system. 
> 
> 5.4 Hence, it should be possible to obtain a true and complete picture of the 
effectiveness of an icing protection system without the expenditure of excessive time 
and effort in the search for extremely severe icing conditions.  
> 
> 5.5 Such results cannot be obtained, however, unless sufficient emphasis has 
been place on research into the basic theories of icing and of protective systems, 
supported by tests to determine the fundamental performance parameters. However, 
sufficient knowledge has been obtained at the moment to enable icing protection 
performance tests to be made on a fairly sound basis.
