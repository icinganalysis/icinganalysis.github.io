## Abstract  

>The convective heat transfer from the surface of an ellipsoidal fore-body 
of fineness ratio 3 and 20-inch maximum diameter was investigated in
clear air for both stationary and rotating operation over a range of 
conditions including air speeds up to 240 knots, rotational speeds up to
1200 rpm, and angles of attack of 0°, 3°, and 6°. The results are presented 
in the form of heat-transfer coefficients and the correlation of
Nusselt and Reynolds numbers. Both a uniform surface temperature and a
uniform input heater density distribution were used.  
> 
>The experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions for
uniform surface temperature distribution. Complete agreement was not obtained 
with uniform input heat density in the laminar-flow region because
of conduction effects. No significant effects of rotation were obtained
over the range of airstream and rotational speeds investigated. Operation
at angle of attack had only minor effects on the local heat transfer.
Transition from laminar to turbulent heat transfer occurred over a wide
range of Reynolds numbers. The location of transition depended primarily
on surface roughness and pressure and temperature gradients. Limited
transient heating data indicate that the variation of surface temperature
with time followed closely an exponential relation.

## Discussion  

>INTRODUCTION  
In the general field of design of modern all-weather aircraft, the
problem of protecting bodies of revolution against icing has become of
increasing importance. Many aircraft components are essentially simple
bodies of revolution; examples of these are radomes, body noses, engine
accessory housings, and the large spinners of turboprop engines. The
design of thermal icing protection systems for these components requires
knowledge of the heat-transfer relations for both stationary and rotating
bodies of revolution. Such information is of interest also in the general
field of heat transfer. Several theoretical studies of the problem have
been made (refs. 1 and 2). However, very little experimental heat-transfer 
data for such bodies are available and the data are generally of
limited scope.  
> 
>Experimental investigations have been made at the NACA Lewis laboratory 
of the heat transfer from bodies of revolution in order to obtain
more extensive data than are presently available, including the effects
of angle of attack and rotation. The investigation was made as part of
a general study of icing and icing protection of bodies of revolution.
This report presents the results of an investigation of the heat transfer
in clear air from the surface of an ellipsoidal forebody of fineness ratio
3 and a 20-inch maximum diameter. Similar results for a larger-diameter
ellipsoidal forebody of fineness ratio 2.5 are reported in reference 3.  
> 
>In the present study the steady-stage convective heat transfer was determined 
with and without rotation of the ellipsoidal forebody over a
range of airspeeds up to 240 knots, rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm, and
angles of attack of 0°, 3°, and limited transient heating data were
also obtained. Heat was provided by an internal electric heater designed
and instrumented to yield as much basic heat-transfer data as possible
while at the same time preserving the performance and constructional details 
of a representative practical heater installation.

>APPARATUS  
> 
>The model, consisting of half of an ellipsoidal body of revolution
with a half major axis of 30 inches and a half minor axis of 10 inches,
was mounted on a faired afterbody in the 6- by 9-foot test section of
the Lewis icing research tunnel (fig. 1). The test model proper, consisting 
of the ellipsoidal forebody, is hereinafter referred to as the
spinner model to distinguish it from the entire assembly. The afterbody,
power-supply system, thermocouple pickup, and temperature recording system
were essentially the same as used in the tests of reference 3. The spinner 
model was fabricated of 0.062-inch aluminum spun in one piece to the
desired shape. An ogive transition section 15 inches long faired the
contour between the rear of the 2O-inch-dianieter spinner and the 30-inch
diameter afterbody. The rear of the spinner model was located at the
same position relative to the afterbody as was the rear of the 30-inch-diameter 
spinner of reference 3. Heat was supplied to the spinner by
electric heaters located on the inside surface of the spinner shell.

>The spinner contour, heater layout, and details of the heater construction 
and thermocouple installation are shown in figure 2. The heater was
divided into eight areas, each constituting a single circuit connected
to separate autotransformers permitting selective control of heat density
and axial heat distribution. The heat input to each heater area was
measured by a voltmeter and an ammeter. The spinner surface area for
each heater is listed in table I. The longitudinal heaters (G and H)
were located on two diametrically opposite sides of the spinner; these
heaters were designed to provide parting areas for subsequent cyclic de-icing tests.  

![Figure 2. Spinner contour and heater details.](/images%2FNACA-TN-3837%2FFigure%202.png)  

>The heating elements consisted of strands of 36-gage Nichrome heating
wires encased between plies of glass cloth and silastic (silicone plastic).
The highier temperature limit of the silicone compared with the neoprene
insulation used in the heaters of reference 3 permitted operation at
higher skin temperatures and heat densities. Copper-constantan thermo-couples 
were installed at various locations to obtain both the skin temperature 
distribution and the inward heat dissipation. A sketch of the
system used to transmit the temperatures from the thermocouples to the
recorder is shown in figure 3(a). Details of the operation of this system are given in reference 4.

>Method of Analysis
> 
>Experimental data. - The experimental results are presented in terms
of the heated-surface temperature rise above the unheated-surface equilibrium 
temperature ts - td, the external convective heat-transfer coefficient H, 
and the local Nusselt number Nu_s.  
> 
>The convective heat-transfer coefficient was computed from the following relations:  

```text
H = Qs / (A ( t - td))
Qs = Q - Qi ± QAl
```

>A sketch of the assumed heat flow from the heater is shown in figure 4.

>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
> 
>Velocity Distribution  
>
>The local velocity over the spinner surface is required in the cor-
relation of the heat-transfer data. In addition, a comparison of the
measured velocity distribution with theoretical values indicates the
magnitude of any tunnel effects and, hence, the validity of the tunnel
simulation. The ratio of the local velocity to the free-stream velocity
is presented in figure 5. These data are uncorrected for tunnel effects,
because this measured value is that which is required for the correlation
of the heat-transfer results. A theoretical curve obtained by the method
of reference 6 for nonviscous incompressible flow is also presented in
figure 5(a) for an angle of attack of 0°.  

![Figure 5. Velocity distribution over spinner.](/images%2FNACA-TN-3837%2FFigure%205.png)

>The experimental data over most of the spinner surface agree well
with the theoretical curve.

>The local velocity distribution for the rotating spinner is compared
with the results for the stationary spinner in figure 5(b) at an angle
of attack of 0°. No significant effect of rotation on the local velocity
was obtained even at the maximum rotational speed (1200 rpm). This result
might be expected, since the local velocities for the stationary spinner
are only 5 percent less, at the most, than the local velocities computed
as the resultants of the longitudinal and rotating components.

>Steady-State Heat-Transfer Results  
> 
>The steady-state heat-transfer results are discussed first in terms
of a general correlation of the results for the separate cases of uniform
surface temperature and uniform input power density, and secondly in relation 
to the specific effect of the several operating variables.  
> 
>Uniform surface temperature. - Typical results obtained with a uniform 
surface temperature are shown in figure 6. The surface temperature
rise, ts - td, heater input power density, and convective heat-transfer
coefficient are given for the stationary spinner at 00 angle of attack.
(The measured unheated equilibrium surface temperature was essentially
constant over the body surface for all tests.) The data of figure 6
were obtained with the spinner surface in its smoothest condition. The
segment average coefficient is shown by the stepped straight lines, while
the data points are the local effective coefficients. The experimental
heat-transfer coefficients agree well with the theoretical stagnation,
laminar, and turbulent values. A fairly extensive region of laminar flow
was obtained, with transition starting approximately 13 inches from the
nose and a fully turbulent condition reached at approximately 24 inches
from the nose. Included in figure 6 is the value of the lower critical
Reynolds number of boundary-layer stability calculated from the analysis
of Schlichting. For values less than the critical the boundary layer is
assumed stable, and transition does not occur in the absence of surface
roughness or other disturbing effects. Transition and boundary-layer
stability are discussed later. Both the surface temperatures and heat-transfer 
coefficients reflect the unfaired stepped heat distribution.

>The heat-transfer results of figure 6 are shown in the Nusselt,
Prandtl, and Reynolds number form in figure 7. In terms of the local
Reynolds number Re_s, transition began at approximately 2.3 X 10^6 and was
completed at approximately 4.2 X 10^6 . Fairing of a smooth curve through
the heat-rate distribution would reduce the spread of the data to approximately 10 percent, 
and the experimental data would vary less than
10 percent from the theoretical values.

ner having uniform surface temperature of 1000 F. Free-stream velocity, 152 knots; air
total temperature, 0° F; angle of attack 0°; free - stream Reynolds number, 3X10^6.](/images%2FNACA-TN-3837%2FFigure%207.png)  

>The heat transfer at several angles of attack and rotational speeds
for the spinner with a uniform surface temperature is compared in figure 8. 
The results of several repeat runs made with the stationary spinner
at 0° angle of attack (fig. 8(a)) indicate good reproducibility of data
and agree well with the theoretical values. These data are similar to
those obtained at a lower stream Reynolds number (fig. 7), except that
the local Reynolds number of transition is lower in figure 8(a). This
forward movement of transition is attributed to the increased surface
roughness in the region of rapidly decreasing velocity gradient (s > 5 in.)
rather than the increased stream Reynolds number or stream turbulence.
During the progress of the tests the entire surface gradually became
roughened by foreign particles in the tunnel airstream, although the
spinner surface was hand-sanded lightly at intervals throughout the course
of the investigation in an effort to keep the degree of surface roughness
fairly constant.

## Conclusions  

>From a study of the convective heat transfer from an ellipsoidal
forebody of fineness ratio 3 in clear air, the following results were
obtained:  
>1. The experimental heat-transfer coefficients for the case of a
uniform surface temperature agreed well with the theoretical predictions
of Drake, Squire, and Martinelli for the stagnation, laminar, and turbulent 
heat-transfer regions. Complete agreement in the laminar-flow region
for the case of uniform input heat density was not obtained because of
conduction effects.
>2. Good correlation of the experimental results for all operating
conditions was obtained by the use of the Nusselt-Prandtl-Reynolds number
relation. No significant effects of rotation on the heat-transfer coefficients 
or transition were obtained for the range of rotational and
airstream speeds investigated. Operation of the spinner at angles of
attack up to 6° had only minor effects on the heat transfer, primarily
causing a movement of transition in accordance with changes in the local
velocity distributions. The time-averaged heat-transfer coefficients
obtained at angle of attack with rotation of the spinner were essentially
the same as obtained at 0° angle for the stationary spinner.
>3. The heat-transfer results for the stationary spinner agreed well
with those obtained with a 30-inch-diameter fineness ratio 2.5 spinner.
>4. Transition from laminar to turbulent heat transfer occurred over
a wide Reynolds number range, including both the movement of beginning
of transition and also the extent of the transition region. The beginning 
of transition varied from a local surface Reynolds number of approximately 
O.8 X106 to 2.3 X 106 (corresponding to a boundary-layer Reynolds
number between 200 and 600), depending upon surface roughness and pressure 
and temperature gradients. Beginning of transition did not occur
forward of 3 to 4 inches from the nose. The end of transition varied
over a local surface Reynolds number range of approximately 3 X 10^6 to
5 X 10^6 . The effects of rotation and angle of attack on transition Reynolds
number were negligible.
>5. Transient heating data were obtained which indicated that the
variation of surface temperature with time was essentially an exponential
relation. The relatively large thermal capacity of the heater-spinner
configuration caused a large temperature-time lag, as indicated by external 
surface time constants of approximately 50 to 80 seconds for both
heating and cooling.
