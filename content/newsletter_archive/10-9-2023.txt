Welcome to the "Blast from the Past" Newsletter!
Reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 1915 to 1958.

- Latest post:

Site Improvements https://icinganalysis.com/site-improvements.html

- Interesting finds:

NACA-RM-54L29, METEOROLOGICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TURBOJET-AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, 1955.
Includes some items about icing.

- Most popular posts (so far...):

#5: Thermal Analysis and Surface Wettedness (NACA-TN-2480) https://icinganalysis.com/naca-tn-313.html
Maybe the under-appreciated effects of surface wettedness are finally getting some attention, or people liked the quote:
"ice formation can be redefined in more general terms as a thermodynamic problem".

- Upcoming posts:

The reposting of revised posts continues on Mastodon https://historians.social/@icinganalysis (and, less reliably, on LinkedIn).
10/11: The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications
10/13: NACA-RM-A9C09, "A Review of Instruments Developed for the Measurement of the Meteorological Factors Conducive to Aircraft Icing"
10/16: The Greatest Thing That You Have (Probably) Never Read: AC 00-6A

- Upcoming Aircraft Icing Events:

Submissions for papers open October 3, and close December 13, for the AIAA Aviation Forum, July 29 to August 2, 2024, so get typing!

- Quote of the week:

"One of the first essentials ... is a method for estimating or calculating the area over which water will strike the wing, and the distribution of water impingement over that area"
NACA-TN-1397

- What is in work:

Porter Perkins thread draft https://icinganalysis.com/drafts/porter-perkins.html
Water-drop impingement thread https://icinganalysis.com/drafts/water-drop-impingement-on-surfaces.html
I might start publishing the Water-drop impingement thread this week or next
(I like to have most of a thread drafted before starting to publish, to make sure it all flows together).

#AltText: Lockheed 12-A. A large, metal construction, low wing, two engine, propeller drive airplane.
The tail has three vertical fins.
Figure 1. Lockheed 12-A airplane.
Alterations were made to a standard commercial model which include provisions for heating the
wings with exhaust gas, and the windshield with heated air.
Figure 12. Three-quarter rear view of airplane, showing location
of air discharge louvers in the wing upper surface and exhaust discharge at the wing tip.

From NACA-ACR-A-53, 1941.
