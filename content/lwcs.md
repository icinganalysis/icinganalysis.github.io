Temperature Laboratory of the N.A.E. [National Aeronautical Establishment (Canada)] 
It is observed that severe icing is not predicted over large areas. 
These curves may be cross plotted on fluid requirement
curves (for example, Figures 7 to 10), assuming constant meteorological conditions 
to 20,000 ft., to determine the fluid requirements at various flight speeds and 
altitudes. If a control for fluid flow is provided, then the 3-mile extent curve 
will simply specify the maximum flow required, while the lower curves enable a 
prediction to be made of the maximum total quantity of fluid required for a given 
flight.

Note that the definitions have no drop size information, 
other than Frase Figure 12 has a separate line for freezing rain. 
I will assume that the curves are applicable to "normal" icing cloud 
drop sizes, including 15 micrometers. 

As we did in 
[Conclusions of the Meteorology of Icing Clouds Thread]({filename}Conclusions%20of%20the%20Meteorology%20of%20Icing%20Clouds%20Thread.md#tracking-lwc-values) 
for data from several sources, 
we will see what LWC value this definition (designated as "N.A.E.") yields 
for the selected condition:  

- Temperature = 32F, MVD = 15 micrometer, 17.4 nmi (20 mile) extent  

| Source         | Year | LWC, g/m^3 |
|----------------|------|------------|
| Rodert         | 1946 | 3.0        |
| NACA-TN-1391   | 1947 | 1.5        |
| NACA-TN-1393   | 1947 | 0.8        |
| NACA-TN-1424 A | 1947 | 1.0        |
| NACA-TN-1424 B | 1947 | 0.8        |
| NACA-TN-1855   | 1949 | 0.8        |
| N.A.E.         | 1953 | 2.25 [!]   |

This is a much different value than what NACA was converging on. 
Fraser cites NACA-TN-1855 (and NACA-TN-2569 and NACA-TN-2738), so at least some 
in the N.A.E. were aware of them. 
Perhaps there was some consideration given specifically to fluid ice 
protection for engines, which might have been viewed as warranting the use 
of conservative values, but that was not explicitly stated in Smith or Fraser.
