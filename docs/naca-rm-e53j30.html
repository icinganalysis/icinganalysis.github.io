<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects of primary and runback ice formations on the section
drag of a 36 0 swept NACA 63A-009 airfoil section with a partial-span
leading-edge slat were studied over a range of angles of attack from 2°
to 8° and airspeeds up to 260 miles per hour for icing conditions with
liquid-water contents ranging from 0.39 to 1.23 grams per cubic meter
and datum air temperatures from 10 to 25 F.</p>
<p>The results with slat retracted showed that glaze-ice formations
caused large and rapid increases in section drag coefficient and that
the rate of change in section drag coefficient for the swept 63A-009
airfoil was about 2 1/2 times that for an unswept 651-212 airfoil. Removal
of the primary ice formations by cyclic de-icing caused the drag to
return almost to the bare-airfoil drag value. A comprehensive study of
the slat icing and de-icing characteristics was prevented by limitations
of the heating system and wake interference caused by the slat tracks
and hot-gas supply duct to the slat. In general, the studies showed
that icing on a thin swept airfoil will result in more detrimental aero-
dynamic characteristics than on a thick unswept airfoil.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is a relatively long (62 page) publication. 
In the interest of brevity,
I will not detail all of its points,
particularly about deicing system design.

<blockquote>
<p>Modern high-speed aircraft frequently have sweptback wings and high-lift 
devices such as leading-edge slats; it is important, therefore, to
investigate such airfoils in icing clouds to determine the differences
in icing and aerodynamic characteristics, if any, between these and conventional 
unswept airfoils. It is desirable to evaluate the effect of
sweepback on the shape of the leading-edge ice formations and the associated 
drag penalties, and compare the icing and drag characteristics of
a slatted airfoil section with those of an unslatted section. Drag
penalties caused by runback and residual ice formations associated with
thermal protection systems utilizing various modes of heating should
also be determined for both slatted and unslatted swept airfoils. With
a thermal ice-protection system employing intermittent heating (cyclic
de-icing), an ice-free spanwise parting strip located near the stagnation 
region facilitates ice removal from unswept airfoils (refs. 2 to 4). 
It is desirable, therefore, to compare the drag characteristics of
a swept airfoil with and without such a parting strip.</p>
<p>The model consisted of a 36° swept NACA 63A-009 airfoil section
incorporating a slatted leading edge over only a portion of span in order
to compare simultaneously the icing characteristics of the slatted section 
with those of the unslatted airfoil. The model was equipped with an
icing-protection system utilizing a combination of electric and hot-gas
heating systems and was operated both continuously and cyclically over
a range of icing conditions. Because of model deficiencies that will be
discussed later, only limited data were obtained for the effect on drag
of ice formations on the slatted portion of the airfoil when the slat
was extended. Primarily, the present report is an extension of reference 
1 to include the drag characteristics of a swept airfoil in icing
conditions.</p>
<p>APPARATUS AND INSTRUMENTATION
The model used in this study (fig. 1) is an NACA 63A-009 airfoil
section of 6.9-foot chord in the streamwise direction and spanning the
6-foot height of the icing research tunnel. The leading and trailing
edges of the model are sweptback at an angle of 36°. The airfoil
leading-edge section consists of two main units, an unslatted or
standard-airfoil section of approximately 28 inches spanwise extent and
a movable slatted leading-edge section (fig. 2). (Herein, spanwise
denotes a direction parallel to the leading edge.) The leading-edge
slat is of 20-inch chord in the streamwise direction and 44 inches in
spanwise extent. The slat moves forward on tracks and rollers into the
air stream in a direction normal to the leading edge. A hydraulic system
is utilized to move and hold the slat in any desired forward position.
The slat tracks are curved so that the extended slat moves on a circular
arc to positions forward of and below the lower surface of the rest of
the airfoil section. The radius of curvature of the tracks is approximately 
34 inches) and the full movement for the slat is over a 16° center
angle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heating System</p>
<p>The slat leading edge was provided with an electrically heated ice-free 
parting strip consisting of a heating element secured to a spanwise
fin which in turn was riveted to the airfoil skin at the stagnation
region for normal cruise angle of attack. Electric heating elements were
also secured around the periphery of the closing ribs at the spanwise
ends of the slat. The upper and lower surfaces of the slat were gas-heated. 
Hot gas was introduced by means of a flexible tube into a D-duct
running spanwise near the leading-edge region of the slat (fig. 2). The
hot gas was distributed to both ends of the slat, then passed through a
double-skin configuration in the upper slat surface) and exhausted into
the center of the slat through small orifices. The lower surface of the
slat near the D-duct baffle was heated by conduction from the baffle and
by the exhaust gas from the upper skin. In addition) a series of six
holes in the D-duct supplied supplemental hot gas to the lower surface.
A portion of the rear face of the slat (slat surface contacting fixed
airfoil when slat is retracted) was provided with a double skin to
increase the heat-transfer characteristics. The trailing lip of the
lower surface was heated by an extension of this double-skin configuration. 
The slat tracks were heated by electric heating elements secured
along both sides of the tracks.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2" src="images/naca-rm-e53J30/Figure 2.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fixed airfoil section behind the slat (downstream) was divided
into four heating zones because of the location of the two slat tracks
and the flexible hot-gas duct to the slat. Each zone was gas-heated by
means of a supply duct from a common header) a spanwise D-duct, and a
chordwise double-skin configuration. Electric heating elements were
used in each zone to obtain an ice-free parting strip near the normal
cruise stagnation region of this airfoil section when the slat was
extended. </p>
<p>Continuous heating. - The drag increase attributable to runback
ice formations was determined for the standard-airfoil section for a
continuous-heating system that does not evaporate all the impinging
water. The study was made for a liquid-water content of 0.80 gram per
cubic meter and angles of attack of 4° and 7°. In addition, one run was
made at 6° angle of attack with a liquid-water content of 1.05 grams per
cubic meter. Such runback icing may be encountered in flight when an
anti-icing system is thermally submarginal for the icing condition. The
heat input to the airfoil was progressively reduced, and the drag-increase 
measurements were coordinated with photographs of the ice formations. 
The drag data are plotted in figure 15 as a function of time
in icing; the accompanying photographs for the runs at 4° and 7° angles
of attack are shown in figure 16.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a 4° angle of attack and with a heating rate of 10,300 Btu per
hour per foot span for the standard airfoil and a combined heating rate
of 11,380 Btu per hour per foot span for the slat and airfoil section
behind the slat, no significant changes in drag were observed during
10 minutes in icing (fig. 15(a)). A small drag increase for the standard-airfoil 
section (maximum of 15-percent increase in 17 1/2 min of icing)
occurred with the heat input reduced to 7670 Btu per hour per foot span
(74 percent of initial value). For the slatted section of the airfoil,
the drag increased markedly when the combined heat input was reduced to
6660 Btu per hour per foot span (59 percent), the drag increase amounting
to 0.0067 (73 percent) in the same 17 1/2 minute icing period. A further
20 minutes with this reduced heat input caused the slatted-section drag
to increase an additional 0.0028. During the same 20-minute icing period,
the standard-airfoil heating rate was reduced to about 46 percent of the
initial value, with a consequent increase in drag from 0.0093 to 0.0148
(59 percent). It is apparent from the data of figure 15(a) and the lower
photographs of the ice formations in figure 16(a) that the large increases 
in drag were caused primarily by the lower-surface ice formations.
An increase in the heating rate caused a reduction in drag (fig. 15(a))
by removing much of the ice on the lower surface. The section drag
coefficient of the standard airfoil did not change appreciably at a 6°
angle of attack until a heat-input value of 5170 Btu per hour per foot
span was reached (32 percent of initial heating rate, fig. 15(b)). A
further reduction in heat input to 2850 Btu per hour per foot span caused
the drag coefficient to increase from about 0.0130 to 0.0177 in an additional 
10 minutes.</p>
<p>At an angle of attack of 7° (fig. 15(c)) with a heating rate varied
downward from 17,500 to 7550 Btu per hour per foot span, no appreciable
drag changes were observed for the standard-airfoil section. For the
slatted section, however, the drag increased with time in icing even
with a heating rate of 18,840 Btu per hour per foot span (combined heating 
rate for slat and airfoil section behind slat). This increase in
drag was caused by the near stall condition of the airfoil at this angle
of attack; hence, small amounts of runback icing on the upper surface
easily induced flow separation, with a consequent rapid increase in drag.
As the heating rate continued to be reduced, the drag of the slatted
section reached a value of 0.039 (combined heating rate of 4290 Btu/(hr)
(ft span)) or 172-percent increase over the initial section drag coefficient. 
As the heating rate of the standard airfoil was also progressively 
reduced to 5380 and 2920 Btu per hour per foot span, the drag
coefficient increased progressively, as shown in figure 15(c), a maximum
section drag coefficient of 0.0201 (95-percent increase) being reached
at the end of the 54 1/2 minute icing time. Photographs of the ice formations 
causing these drag values are shown in figure 16(b). A correlation
of the data of figure 15 with the photographs of figure 16(b) indicates
that the initial drag increases for the standard-airfoil section were
caused primarily by ice formations on the lower surface in conjunction
with light runback icing on the upper surface. The final large drag
increase was caused by heavy ice formations on both surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have designed and tested several anti-ice systems, 
and my opinion is that 18,000 BTU/h-ft. heating is "a lot", to use a technical term.</p>
<p>Also note: <strong>"small amounts of runback icing on the upper surface
easily induced flow separation"</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DISCUSSION<br>
In general, the section drag characteristics of the swept NACA
63A-009 airfoil with slat retracted are more adversely affected by the
presence of ice formations in the leading-edge region than are those of
the unswept NACA 651-212 airfoil (ref. 1). At low rates of water catch,
the rate of drag increase for the unheated swept 63A-009 airfoil is
approximately 2 1/2 times as great as that of the unswept airfoil of reference 
1 for similar icing conditions. Several factors are believed to
contribute to the greater rate of drag change for the 63A-009 airfoil.
The chord of the swept 63A-009 airfoil was approximately 14 percent
smaller and the thickness was 25 percent less than those of the unswept
65 1 -212 airfoil. The effect of these reductions in size is to yield a
higher drag value for a constant ice or protuberance size (see refs. 1
and 6 for the effect of protuberance height on drag values). In addition, 
the three-dimensional effects introduced by airfoil sweep probably
result in an increase in the length of the boundary-layer path over the
leading-edge-region, over that occurring with two-dimensional flow; hence,
the disruptive effects on the boundary layer by the ice formations in
the leading-edge region are probably greater and contribute to the
greater drag values.    </p>
<p>The results reported herein corroborate the data of reference 1,
which show that a heavy glaze-ice formation resulting from icing
encounters with combinations of high liquid-water content, large droplet
size, high airspeed, and high datum air temperatures will cause large
and rapid increases in drag that may be detrimental to aircraft operation. 
Also, the operation of an aircraft with glaze ice on the leading-edge 
region in a landing-approach condition should be avoided in order to
minimize the possibility of airfoil stall due to these ice formations.
In order to compare a continuous-heating system with a thermal
cyclic de-icing system in an operational analysis, the relation between
the rate of change of drag with the heating rate is required. From the
continuous-heating data of figures 6 and 15, the average time rate of
change in drag coefficient can be determined as a function of heating
rate, as shown in figure 23. These data are for moderate to high rates
of water catch and include angles of attack of 4°, 6°, and 7°.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 23" src="images/naca-rm-e53J30/Figure23.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a reasonable scatter, the data for the standard-airfoil section appear
to fall on a single curve over most of the range shown. No apparent
drag increase is indicated for a heating rate greater than 9000 Btu per
hour per foot span; whereas, with no heating, the data indicate some
variation in drag increase per unit time with angle of attack (fig. 6).
Although the residual ice formations for heating rates of about 3000
Btu per hour per foot span are relatively large (see fig. 16(b)), the
rate of drag increase is only of the order of 30 percent of the drag
increase for an unheated airfoil. The limit of heating rate for zero
drag increase (around 9000 Btu/(hr)(ft span)) is somewhat doubtful,
since the afterbody of the airfoil was heated to prevent frost accumulations;
consequently, runback ice formations beyond the gas-heated
leading-edge section (20 percent of chord) could not be evaluated.
Only a single reliable data point (fig. 23) at a 4° angle of attack
was obtainable for the slatted-airfoil section with the slat retracted
and with continuous heating. It is believed that data for the slatted-airfoil 
section lie somewhat higher than those for the standard-airfoil
section because of the peculiarities in the air flow over the swept
model. It also appears probable that additional data may indicate separate 
curves for each angle of attack, especially at low heating rates
(less than 5000 Btu/(hr)(ft span)).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The results of a study of the effects of ice formations on the section 
drag of a 36° swept NACA 63A-009 airfoil with partial-span leading-edge 
slat may be summarized as follows:<br>
1. Glaze-ice formations in the leading-edge region of the airfoil
caused large and rapid increases in section drag coefficient. In general, 
the icing of thin swept airfoils will result in greater aerodynamic
penalties than for thick unswept airfoils. The change in drag coefficient 
in icing conditions for the swept 63A-009 airfoil with slat retracted 
was of the order of 2 1/2 times as great as that for an unswept
651-212 airfoil.<br>
2.  Removal of the primary ice formations by cyclic de-icing caused
the drag to return almost to the bare-airfoil drag coefficient. The
increment of drag increase remaining after the heating period was caused
by residual runback ice formations and ice remaining on the surface
because of limitations of the heating system.<br>
3. The section drag coefficient for the unheated airfoil in icing
conditions was substantially unaffected by the use of an ice-free parting 
strip at the stagnation region.<br>
4. With the slat extended, initial (dry air) drag coefficient values
were increased threefold over the drag values with slat retracted because
of wake effects caused by the slat tracks and the hot-gas supply line;
consequently, an evaluation of absolute drag of the slatted-airfoil section 
was impossible. The rate of change in drag coefficient in icing
conditions with the slat extended was of the same order of magnitude as
with the slat retracted.<br>
5. A glaze-ice formation on the leading-edge section for a let-down
and approach condition, during which the airfoil angle of attack is
increased from low to high angles of attack (7° or 8°), caused a large
increase in section drag coefficient, especially when the slat was
extended at the high angle of attack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a little skeptical about the pressure rake being able to sort out
accurately the drag for the limited span slat. </p>
<p>I am also skeptical that the limited span slat, 
with tracks and hot-gas supply line, 
represents the performance of a more typical slat span. 
It seems to me that blockage and end effects would be over-represented. 
However, only so much model will fit into the icing tunnel, 
so this was the best data available at the time. </p>
<p>Tunnel wall corrections (if any) were not discussed. </p>
