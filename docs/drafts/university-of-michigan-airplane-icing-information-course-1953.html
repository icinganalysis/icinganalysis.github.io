<em>See Lecture No. 6, "Energy Exchanges During Icing", Messinger, Bernard L.</em>   </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Thirteen lectures show the "state of the art" in 1953.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Several lectures are extracts of earlier works, or were republished later.  </li>
<li>This was almost an aircraft icing design guide.  </li>
<li>Selected lectures are reviewed.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Since there was no introduction in the bound book copy I read 
(it simply starts with Lecture 1). 
Here is a listing of the lecture titles and authors
(I could not find this seemingly basic information online).  </p>
<ol>
<li>"Supercooled Clouds" Vonnegut, Bernard    </li>
<li>"The Mechanics of Suspensions", Brun, Edmond  </li>
<li>"The Trajectories of Water Drops", Tribus, Myron  </li>
<li>"Heat Transfer from Streamlined Bodies", Eckert, E. R. G.  </li>
<li>"Mass Transfer at High Velocities", Mickley, Harold S.  </li>
<li>"Energy Exchanges During Icing", Messinger, Bernard L.  </li>
<li>"The Design of Air-Heated Thermal Ice-Prevention Systems", Neel, Carr B.  </li>
<li>"Electro-Thermal De-Icing Systems Their Design and Control", Orr, J. L.  </li>
<li>"Design of Air Heated Intermittent De-Icers", Hauger, Harry H. Jr.  </li>
<li>"Mechanical De-Icing Systems", Loughborough, D. L.  </li>
<li>"The Design of Fluid Anti-Icing Systems", Smith, E. L.  </li>
<li>"Meteorological Design Requirements for Icing Protection Systems", and "Note on the Flight Testing and Assessment of Icing Protection Systems" Fraser, Don   </li>
<li>"Icing Simulation", Morrison, R. B., Nicholls, James A.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The 13 lectures were an almost complete education on aircraft icing design, 
for the time period, and about as much as could be packed into a one-week course.  </p>
<p>This constituted the best <a href="/design-manuals.html">Icing Design Manual</a> 
available at the time.  </p>
<h3>The printed course lectures</h3>
<p>The print copy that I borrowed through inter-library loan 
has no introductory material, it simply starts with Lecture No. 1. 
(I speculate that there was some kind of introduction at the course,
or at least an agenda, that is not included.)</p>
<p>From the front piece of Lecture No. 9 we learn that the course was 
March 30 to April 3, 1953 
(the week before Easter [April 5, 1953], and possibly coinciding with spring break at the university?). </p>
<p>The compiled printing is 500+ pages. 
Some lectures are very information dense, 
so I view five days as intense, "a drink out of a fire hose". </p>
<p>There are also errata sheets inserted for two of the lectures. 
The errata sheets are printed differently (mimeograph rather than print), 
so not all print copies may have the errata. </p>
<h3>Copyright Status</h3>
<p>The copyright status for this is ambiguous. 
The print copy that I borrowed through inter-library loan 
is not marked as copyrighted, 
nor are any of the individual lectures. </p>
<p>However, a librarian told me (paraphrased) that
while they would like to make digital copies available, 
they do not have signed releases from all presenters and authors, 
so they were not able to do so. 
And it is unlikely that releases could now be obtained, 
as it is not likely that most of the authors are still with us. </p>
<p>I suppose that this also means that there will not be a re-publication 
any time soon.  </p>
<h3>Similar publications</h3>
<p>Some lectures are recognizably extracts from other publications, 
or were in part or in whole published later.  </p>

</ul>
<p>Lecture No. 2, "The Mechanics of Suspensions" by Edmond Brun, notes:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that prior to 1940, the study of trajectories of particle suspensions
had not produced many important reports. 
The study of airplane icing phenomena in England yielded works by 
G. I. Taylor and M. Glauert. 
Without knowing about these contributions, I started on the entire problem 
during the war with some assistants of mine.  </p>
<p>Langmuir and Blodgett's work and other recent American studies, 
among those ones by Myron Tribus, 
provide an important link in the general studies of the Mechanics of Suspensions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Lecture No. 2 largely discusses impingement on cylinders, 
you can find most of the information in 
<a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Langmuir and Blodgett "Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories"
</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>For Lecture No. 4 by Eckert, it is a short summary of convective heat and mass 
transfer analysis methods. You can find far more by Eckert in his well known 
"Analysis of Heat and Mass Transfer" text book <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (cited over 3000 times).  </p>
<p>So, if you are waiting for an inter-library loan, 
you can read these (possibly more accessible) publications 
to get similar information in the meantime.  </p>
<p>The lectures themselves are not often cited in literature, 
possibly because the similar publications get cited instead. </p>

<h2>Citations</h2>
<p>The "Airplane Icing Information Course" is cited 7 times at scholar.google.com. </p>
<p>The individual lectures have not been widely cited.  </p>
<p>For example, Messinger's "Energy Exchanges During Icing" was not found at scholar.google.com, 
although I have seen three or four citations elsewhere. 
I speculate that Messinger's other publications with similar information get cited instead. </p>
<p>Fraser's "Meteorological Design Requirements for Icing Protection Systems" is cited 7 times 
at scholar.google.com. 
"Note on the Flight Testing and Assessment of Icing Protection Systems" is cited 3 times.</p>
<p>The course material endured after the initial presentation, 
even if they were not cited often. 
At a company that I worked at I remember seeing copies of some of the lectures, 
decades later (Lecture No. 6 by Messinger most frequently). </p>
<h2>Related</h2>
<p>This earlier publication by Tribus "Modern Icing Technology", 1952, merits reading. 
We covered it briefly in <a href="/design-manuals.html">Design Manuals</a>. 
It is sort of a 150-page draft of what is in the later Airplane Icing Information Course. </p>
