<p>Aircraft designs for flight in icing are improved and proven effective by several tools, 
including analysis, icing wind tunnel test, and flight test in icing conditions. </p>
<p>Design handbooks have charts and tables that can be used to perform analyses for 
aircraft icing and ice protection. </p>

<p>There are computerized icing analysis tools available from NASA, and from commercial vendors. 
There is also "bespoke" software created for special purposes. </p>

<p>A wind tunnel is a large tube with a fan to produce air flow at a calibrated airspeed. 
Wind tunnels are used to study many effects on aircraft, including icing. 
Artificially produced ice shapes (often 3D printed) may be adhered to airplane models, and the effects studied. </p>
<p>To simulate in-flight icing conditions, 
<a href="/drafts/terminology.html#icing-wind-tunnel">"Icing Wind Tunnels"</a> often use refrigeration to reach air temperatures below the melting point of ice, 
and water spray to produce drop sizes similar to those in nature
(some do not have refrigeration, and wait for a day with cold enough weather for testing).</p>

<p>Flight tests are used to determine that ice protection systems operate as intended.  </p>

<p>Flight tests may be conducted using artificial ice shapes.<br>

<p>Flight test is one way of determining the effects of ice on the performance of the aircraft.  </p>

<p>As a final proof that everything works as intended, flight tests in natural icing conditions are conducted.  </p>
