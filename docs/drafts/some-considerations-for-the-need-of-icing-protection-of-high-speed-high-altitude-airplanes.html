<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper considers the performance penalty caused by icing during climb 
in terms of reduction in rate of climb and in range for aircraft without 
airframe icing protection. It should be noted that the paper is intended 
to show only orders of magnitude rather than absolute values.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This paper is brief, so it is reproduced here in its entirety.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The need for icing protection of aircraft operating at relatively low airspeeds 
and at altitudes less than 20,000 feet has been long recognized. These aircraft 
often operate long distances in continuous icing conditions. If the aircraft 
were not equipped with icing protection systems, long icing encounters could result 
in severe performance penalties and possible loss of the aircraft. 
For high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, however, the icing problem appears 
to be much less hazardous. These high-speed aircraft cruise at altitudes 
at which little, if any, icing occurs. The icing problem for these aircraft, 
therefore, is confined to climb and let-down conditions. Because of the high rates 
of climb and descent, the icing encounters for these aircraft are of short duration. 
For example, a fighter with a 20,000-foot-per-minute rate of climb would pass through 
a 2000-foot cloud in a matter of 6 seconds, assuming no losses due to icing. 
Similarly, a transport with a 3000-foot-per-minute rate of climb would require 
40 seconds to climb through the same cloud.  </p>
<p>The performance losses in icing can be minimized by the use of an icing protection system 
at the expense of structural complexities and installed weight. 
The engine and inlet must, of course, be protected to prevent engine damage by 
ice chunks passing into the engine. The elimination of airframe protection systems 
for aircraft subject only to short icing encounters appears attractive, 
provided the performance penalty due to icing is not excessive.</p>
<p>Research has been conducted at the NACA to determine the aerodynamic penalties 
associated with ice formations on various aircraft components. 
These studies were supplemented by experimental and theoretical data 
on where and how much water in the clouds impinges on airfoils. 
In addition, the time required to remove ice formations from 
an unheated surface by sublimation was determined experimentally. 
These research programs have laid the foundation for estimating the 
performance penalties of unprotected aircraft in icing conditions.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration, two hypothetical aircrafts similar to current designs 
and a flight plan such as shown in figure 1 are considered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Flight plans for hypothetical aircraft." src="/images%2FConsiderations%20of%20the%20Need%20for%20Icing%2FFigure%201.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aircraft are assumed to climb through an icing condition to a cruise altitude 
of 40,000 feet. The first aircraft is a fighter of Mach 2.0 flight capability. 
The characteristics of the fighter are: climb and cruise speed of Mach 0.9, 
and an initial rate of climb at sea level of 26,500 feet per minute. 
The characteristics of the second aircraft, a large transport, are: 
climb speed of Mach 0.5 and a cruise speed of Mach 0.8, 
and an initial rate of climb of 3315 feet per minute.</p>
<p>The icing conditions and altitude of icing encounter for the flight plan 
were selected to provide glaze ice formations which, as will be discussed 
later, provide the largest aerodynamic penalties for airfoils. 
The ambient air temperature at which glaze ice will form on airfoil surfaces 
is a function of the amount of aerodynamic heating associated with the aircraft speed. 
The fighter with a speed of Mach 0.9 consequently has greater aerodynamic heating 
on the airfoil surfaces than the transport operating at Mach 0.5. 
The fighter, therefore, can fly through much colder icing conditions 
than the transport before glaze icing occurs. in appreciable quantities 
on the airfoil surfaces. Heavy glaze ice formation will occur on the 
fighter at an air temperature of -21° C and on the transport at -7° C. 
The altitude at which icing occurs increases with a lower air temperature. 
Consequently, the icing of the fighter occurs at a higher altitude (15,000 ft) 
than the icing of the transport (5000 ft). </p>
<p>Lower air temperatures are also associated with lower water content values. 
The fighter, therefore, passes through clouds containing an average water content 
value of 0.5 gram per cubic meter, while the transport passes through clouds 
containing 1.1 grams per cubic meter. Both aircraft are assumed to climb through 
a single cloud layer of 2000 feet vertical extent. The NACA statistical 
icing program data were used to establish these meteorological conditions. 
The combination of meteorological values selected are considered severe, 
and the probability of exceeding these combinations is less than 1 in 1000 icing encounters.</p>
<p>The airfoil drag penalties (fig. 2) caused by the ice formations obtained under 
these meteorological conditions can be determined from data obtained in the icing tunnel. 
These data show that section drag increase due to airfoil icing can be correlated 
with the total amount of ice accumulated on the airfoil and the type of ice formation. 
The section drag increase data fall into two general categories, that caused by 
light glaze and rime icing and that caused by heavy glaze icing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Increase in airfoil section drag due to icing." src="/images%2FConsiderations%20of%20the%20Need%20for%20Icing%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Light glaze icing results from low water contents, small droplets, and surface temperatures 
near freezing. Rime icing is associated primarily with low surface temperatures. 
Both types of icing in this category result in relatively streamlined ice formations 
that blend into the airfoil shape and do not add excessively to airfoil section drag. 
Heavy glaze icing results from high water contents, large droplets, 
and surface temperatures near freezing. This combination of meteorological conditions 
results in rough ice formations that protrude from the airfoil surface into the air stream, 
thereby causing large section drag losses. </p>
<p>For the glaze icing that occurs on the airfoils for the icing condition selected, 
airfoil section drag increases of 60 and 13 percent are obtained 
for the transport and fighter, respectively.</p>
<p>The significance of these section drag increases on the performance 
of the two hypothetical aircraft will now be considered. 
During the climb, the aircraft are assumed to maintain constant thrust and forward speed. 
Consequently, the airfoil drag change due to icing will affect only the rate of climb. 
Since the drag change is a function of time in the icing conditions, 
aircraft with high rates of climb are less affected by icing than 
those with low rates of climb. The loss in climb rate for 
both hypothetical aircraft as a function of the initial rate of climb 
before icing occurs is shown in figure 3.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 3. CLimb loss due to icing." src="/images%2FConsiderations%20of%20the%20Need%20for%20Icing%2FFigure%203.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the fighter, a loss in climb rate of less than 3 percent is obtained, 
while the transport suffers a climb rate loss of 15 percent. 
A lower initial rate of climb results in a rapid increase in the climb rate loss during icing, 
increase in initial rate of climb somewhat decreases the climb rate loss during icing. 
The change in climb rate loss with initial rate of climb is not linear because 
the time in icing is a function of rate of climb and airfoil drag change, 
both of which vary throughout the icing encounter.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the aircraft performance penalties, 
the ice accumulated during climb should be removed from the unprotected surfaces. 
This ice removal in the absence of an icing protection system is accomplished 
by a sublimation process. In this process the ice evaporatės directly from 
the solid to the vapor state without melting. Experimental data obtained 
at the NACA Lewis laboratory was used to calculate the ice sublimation rates 
for the two hypothetical aircraft (fig. 4). These calculated sublimation rates 
are shown in figure 4 as a function of altitude. At the low altitudes 
the sublimation rates due to the higher air temperatures are to 22 times greater 
than at high altitude. The sublimation rate is also greater at high speed 
than at low speed, as shown by the comparison of the sublimation rates 
for the fighter with those of the transport. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. Sublimation of ice from hypothetical aircraft." src="/images%2FConsiderations%20of%20the%20Need%20for%20Icing%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the climb to cruise altitude (fig. 5) after the icing encounter, 
55 percent of the ice on the fighter airfoil (based on maximum ice thickness) 
is removed by sublimation. The total time to remove all of the ice 
from the fighter is less than 5 minutes. For the transport, 
only 24 percent of the ice is removed during climb and 
a total sublimation time of 485 minutes is required for removal of all the ice. 
The long ice removal time for the transport is caused by the large percentage 
of ice left on the surfaces after the climb and the low ice sublimation rates.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 5. Sublimation times for hypothetical aircraft." src="/images%2FConsiderations%20of%20the%20Need%20for%20Icing%2FFigure%205.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The longer time required to reach cruise altitude and the loss in forward speed caused by 
an icing encounter result in a decrease in the aircraft range or a depletion of the fuel reserves. 
The performance decrease in icing is considered negligible for the fighter because of 
the small effect of the airfoil drag penalties on rate of climb, speed, and range. 
For the original flight plan of the transport, the forward speed is decreased 
by 5.5 percent at the start of cruise at 40,000 feet. This loss in forward speed 
is gradually reduced as the ice is removed during cruise. 
The deterioration in performance due to airfoil icing causes a reduction 
in range for the transport. For an initial range of 2200 miles, the range after 
an icing encounter during climb is reduced by 5 percent, while for an initial range of 4200 miles, 
the range after an icing encounter is reduced by 3 percent.  </p>
<p>The higher sublimation rates at low altitudes suggest the possibility of an alternate 
flight plan (fig. 6) to reduce the time required to sublimate the ice formations and 
thereby reduce the loss in range. With this flight plan, a change to level flight is made 
immediately after emerging out of the icing condition and flying horizontally until 
all the ice has been sublimated. The climb to the cruise altitude can then be continued 
free of ice. Since the fuel rate will be increased by operating at low altitude, 
the feasibility of this flight plan depends on the balancing of the decreased range loss 
resulting from the lower sublimation time with the range loss resulting from 
the increased fuel rate during this time. With the alternate flight plan 
the sublimation time for the fighter is decreased from about 5 minutes to 1 minute. 
For the transport the sublimation time with alternate flight plan is substantially 
reduced to only 23 minutes compared with the 485 minutes required with the original flight plan. 
If the speed in level flight for the transport is increased from Mach 0.5 to Mach 0.65, 
the time to remove the ice is further reduced to 12 minutes because of 
the increased sublimation rate at this higher speed. In the latter case if the fuel rate 
at low altitude exceeds that at high altitude by a factor of approximately 2.0, 
no benefit is achieved by sublimation at low altitude, 
since the decreased range loss due to a lower sublimation time is offset by 
the increased fuel rate at the lower altitude. Because the fuel rate 
for jet engines at low altitude is of the order of 4 times that at high altitude, 
the alternate flight plan does not appear feasible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the aircraft considered, it appears that the let-down condition with a possible go-around 
in icing conditions poses the greatest icing problem. Under such conditions 
the possibility exists that stability and control problems could be encountered. 
No problem is anticipated from a possible deterioration of lift and drag increase due to icing, 
since sufficient thrust is available to counteract these factors. The type of ice formations 
that a fighter might encounter during an 8-minute go-around in icing is shown 
in figure 7 and illustrates the size of the glaze ice formations that could be accumulated. 
The maximum thickness of the ice formation near the leading edge is over 1 inch. 
The effect of such ice formations on the control effectiveness and aircraft stability 
during the let-down and landing operation has not been assessed.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A program to appraise the control problem associated with airfoil icing is contemplated for the near future. 
If the results of this program indicate that airfoil icing does not affect aircraft control, 
high performance fighters with flight plans such as assumed herein will require no airframe icing protection. 
If, on the other hand, an aircraft control problem due to airfoil icing does exist, 
a limited protection system that will protect the portion of the wing ahead of the control surfaces 
may be required for let-down through icing conditions. 
Such a limited icing protection system does not require the structural complexities of full protection systems. 
A limited icing protection system also would not impose large installed weights 
nor appreciably penalize the aircraft performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arguments presented above have largely been followed. 
Many high-performance, "fighter" type aircraft have only limited ice protection, 
largely for air data probes, and some engine inlet components. 
Depending on the intended use, some mission profiles may involve long duration 
hold and low speed loitering at altitudes where icing is more likely, 
even if the aircraft is capable of high-speed, high-altitude operations. 
In those cases, more complete ice protection may be required. </p>
