<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the temperature 
profile downstream of a heated-air jet directed perpendicularly to an air 
stream. The profiles were determined at several positions downstream of 
the jet as functions of jet density, jet velocity, free stream density, 
free-stream velocity, jet temperature, and orifice flow coefficient.  </p>
<p>A method is presented which yields a good approximation of the temperature 
profile in terms of dimensionless parameters of the flow and geometric 
conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The heating of an air stream by means of an air jet directed 
perpendicularly to the air stream is reported in references 1 and 2. 
These investigations were conducted to determine the penetration of a 
jet into the air stream at various downstream positions as a function 
of the jet and stream-flow conditions and of the size and shape of the 
orifices from which the jet issued. The practical application of such a 
heating system requires a knowledge of the temperature profile at any 
point downstream of the orifice as well as the penetration of the jet 
into the air stream.  </p>
<p>An investigation was therefore conducted in a 2- by 20-inch tunnel at 
the NACA Lewis laboratory to determine the temperature profile in the 
plane of a jet at several positions downstream of a jet directed 
perpendicularly to an air stream. Four heated air jets were investigated 
for a range of free-stream velocities, jet total temperatures, and jet 
total pressures.</p>
<p>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The orifices used in the investigation were circular thin-plate orifices 
with diameters of 0.250, 0.385, 0.500, and 0.625 inch. Each orifice was 
investigated over a range of pressure ratios (ratio of jet total pressure 
to outlet static pressure) from 1.20 to 3.70 for jet total temperatures of 
approximately 200°, 300°, and 400° F at free stream velocities of 
160, 275, and 390 feet per second. Air for the jets was obtained by 
passing high-pressure air through an electric heater and into a plenum 
chamber, the upper wall of which contained the orifices as shown in 
figure 1.  </p>
<p>The temperature profiles were measured at three positions down stream of 
the orifice center line by means of thermocouple rakes. A rake consisting 
of 22 thermocouple probes spaced 0.500 inch apart was permanently mounted 
at the rearmost position (20.31 in.) downstream of the orifice center line. 
A moveable rake consisting of 33 thermocouple probes spaced 0.250 inch 
apart was used to measure the temperature profiles at stations 4.81 and 
11.81 inches downstream of the orifice center line.  </p>
<p>The tunnel boundary layer was removed by suction upstream of the orifice to minimize tunnel-wall boundary-layer effects. (See fig. 1.)<br>
</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The correlation curve of penetration coefficient as a function of the 
final parameter is shown in figure 15. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of the scatter in figure 16 
results from the difficulty in determining X2 from the temperature 
profiles, particularly for the small-diameter jets at the middle and 
rearmost rake positions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 16. Variation of upper-slope coefficient with parameter." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2466%2FFigure%2016.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most instances, the actual values of x2 are so small (1 in.) that 
small difference in reading the 
temperature and fairing the profiles resulted in errors as high as
20 percent in X2 Several sets of data were taken under the same conditions 
to determine the reproducibility of the data. Although the profiles were 
similar, particularly in the upper region (Mu and X1), the values of X2 
varied about 10 percent because of the instability of the jet in the 
lower region. Although these errors in X2 are large
percentagewise, the actual error in the over-all profile should not 
preclude its practical usefulness.  </p>
<p>Correlation of Slope Coefficients</p>
<p>In previous discussion of the profile characteristics, it was noted that 
the upper and lower slopes of the profiles were independent of 
jet-pressure ratio for pressure ratios greater than 1.87. The slopes are 
therefore independent of density ratio, and its effect need not be 
considered in the analysis. In addition, because the jets are choked, 
the jet velocity is constant for a given jet total temperature and, 
hence, the velocity ratio is constant for a particular tunnel velocity. 
All the data obtained at one rake station for a single jet diameter, 
jet total temperature, and free-stream velocity may therefore be 
represented by a single value. Proceeding with the analysis from this 
point leads to the final correlation parameter (Vj/V0)^0.65 (s/Dj) (w/Dj) 
for the upper-slope coefficient Mu (Tj-To)/Dj as shown in figure 16. 
The final correlation parameter for lower slope coefficient Ml (Tj-To)/Dj
was found to be (s/Dj)^1.25 (Vj/Vo)^0.53 as shown in figure 17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correlation of Maximum Temperature Rise Coefficient</p>
<p>In the previous discussion of profile characteristics, the temperature 
rise at a given rake station was shown to be nearly independent of 
jet-pressure ratio for a particular jet diameter, jet temperature, and 
free-stream velocity. The temperature rise decreases slightly with 
decreasing pressure ratio (fig. 2(a)). Because the flow coefficient also 
decreases slightly with decreasing pressure ratio (reference 3), the 
coefficient  ΔTm/C (Tj-To) was investigated and found to be independent 
of density ratio; it was therefore correlated with the remaining parameters. 
A further simplification of the analysis resulted when it was found that 
 ΔTm/C (Tj-To) was independent of velocity ratio at a particular rake 
station and jet temperature. A plot of  ΔTm/C (Tj-To) was therefore 
made as a function of the mixing distance to diameter ratio s/Dj and an 
independent curve was obtained for each jet diameter. Further analysis 
of these data showed that if the coefficient  ΔTm/C (Tj-To) was multiplied 
by the width coefficient (w/Dj), a single curve was obtained for all jet 
temperatures as shown in figure 18. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The maximum temperature-rise coefficient ΔTm/C (Tj-To) is 
therefore a function only of the mixing distance to diameter ratio.</p>
<p>Comparison of Calculated and Experimental Profiles</p>
<p>The correlation of the penetrations, slopes, and maximum temperature rise 
with the flow and geometric parameters presented in the foregoing 
discussion provides a means for obtaining an approximation of the 
temperature profile.</p>
<p>A number of profiles were calculated, based on the experimental conditions, 
and compared with the actual profiles. Some typical results are shown in 
figure 19. A study of these figures shows that the penetration X1, the 
upper slope Mu, and the temperature rise ΔTm are in satisfactory agreement 
with the experimental profile. The penetration x2 and the lower slope ML 
show lesser agreement because, as previously mentioned, good 
reproducibility of these data is difficult to obtain. In general, 
however, the approximate solution is in good agreement with the 
experimental data and provides a reasonably simple method for obtaining 
the temperature profile.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A method that provides a reasonably simple means of obtaining the 
approximate temperature profile downstream of a heated-air jet directed 
perpendicularly to an air stream has been presented. The solution is 
presented in terms of dimensionless parameters of the flow and the 
geometric conditions.</p>
