<em>From Rodert, NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention</em>  </p>
<p>NACA hosted several conferences, some of them including the topic of aircraft icing. 
At the conferences NACA had the opportunity to communicate their achievements to a wider audience. 
The presentations are typically briefer than publications, 
so you can learn quickly from them.  </p>
<p>These works span much of the NACA aircraft icing publications era. 
"NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention" (1947) summarizes early works. </p>
<p>"Icing Conditions to be Expected in Operation of High-Speed, High-Altitude Airplanes" and 
"Some Considerations of the Need for Icing Protection of High-Speed, High-Altitude Airplanes" 
are from a conference in 1954, when emphasis had shifted to jet aircraft.  </p>
<p>"The Icing Problem" (1956) summarizes much of the later work
(however, there were important publications after 1956). </p>
<p>I have not found summaries of the "state of the art" for the NACA era  that are comparable to 
"NACA Conference on Aircraft Ice Prevention" and 
"The Icing Problem".  </p>
<p>[Except, perhaps, the <a href="/university-of-michigan-airplane-icing-information-course-1953.html">University of Michigan Airplane Icing Information Course, 1953</a>.]  </p>
<p>These publications are from conferences are part of <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">The Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a> 
category labeled "Miscellaneous". </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"The subject of aircraft ice protection has provoked much controversy and discourse among theorists, designers, laboratory and test engineers, and flight operations people."</em>  </p>
<p>Technical papers were presented by government research and test
organizations, aircraft engine and aircraft manufacturers, military
services. and airline operators. The symposium presentations were
given by government and industry representatives with particular
expertise in the development, testing, operation, and maintenance
of aircraft ice protection systems.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this occurred after the NACA era, there was still significant NACA influence. 
The first two presentations were by former NACA authors, and recapped NACA research:    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Review of Icing Criteria; William Lewis  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description, History and Status of NASA-Lewis Icing Research Tunnel; Vernon H. Gray  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the other 16 presentations, by a non NACA-author, that nonetheless references NACA works:  </p>
