<p>The water that causes most aircraft in-flight icing is small drops in clouds. 
Average drop sizes are typically 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter
(for comparison, a human hair is about 50 to 100 micrometers in diameter).</p>
<p>Air temperature in the atmosphere tends to decrease with altitude. 
Air with moisture as water drops and vapor can rise and cool, 
from a temperature above 0°C (32°F) to below 0°C. 
This is how many icing clouds form. </p>
<p>The water drops in an icing cloud are liquid at a temperature at or below 0°C (32°F), 
in what is termed a "Supercooled" state. 
Almost any disturbance can lead to freezing of the drops. 
Fairly often (more than half of colder clouds) this happens 
spontaneously, without an outside influence, and the cloud 
can become ice crystals rather than liquid water drops. </p>
<p>A scenario at a weather front that can produce supercooled icing conditions:<br>
<img alt="Figure 20-1.png" src="/images%2FFAA-H-8083-28%2FFigure%2020-1.png"><br>
<em>from <a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulationspolicies/handbooksmanuals/aviation/faa-h-8083-28-aviation-weather-handbook">FAA-H-8083-28, "Aviation Weather Handbook"</a></em>  </p>
<p>The disturbance of most interest to aircraft icing is when a supercooled 
water drop impinges on the surface of an aircraft moving through the cloud. 
The water freezes on the aircraft surface and forms ice shapes. 
This can affect the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. </p>
<p>Much study has been done on the conditions that cause icing on an aircraft in flight. 
The data were collected into graphs in design documents and certification requirements. 
They give expected values for intensity or concentration of supercooled water in g/m^3 
("Liquid Water Content" or "LWC"), 
and mean or average drop size 
("Mean Effective Drop Diameter" "MED" or "Median Volumetric Diameter" "MVD"). 
Other factors also have to be specified, such as temperature and altitude, 
for a complete definition. </p>
<p>A definition of icing conditions:<br>
<img alt="AppCfig1.png" src="/images%2FAppCfig1.png"><br>
<em><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25/appendix-Appendix%20C%20to%20Part%2025">from Part 25 Appendix C (1964)</a></em>  </p>
<p>"Continuous Maximum Icing Conditions" are for stratiform or layer-type clouds, 
which can extend for several miles.  </p>
<p>"Intermittent Maximum Icing Conditions" are for cumuliform  or "storm" type clouds, 
which extend over a lesser distance, but have more intense icing conditions.  </p>
<p>Regulations cover large drop icing conditions, 
termed "Appendix O", were published in 2014. 
These have lWC values and extents roughly comparable to Continuous Maximum Icing Conditions, 
but have larger drop sizes. There are four detailed conditions definitions. 
The "Freezing Drizzle" definition includes drop sizes over 200 micrometers. 
The "Freezing Rain" definition includes drop sizes over 1000 micrometers. 
The larger drops can cause icing in locations where Appendix C 
size drops do not reach. </p>
<p>A wind tunnel is a large tube with a fan to produce air flow at a calibrated airspeed. 
They are commonly used in aircraft development to simulate flight conditions. 
To simulate in-flight icing conditions, 
"Icing Wind Tunnels" often use refrigeration to reach air temperatures below the melting point of ice, 
and water spray to produce drop sizes similar to those in nature
(some do not have refrigeration, and wait for a day with cold enough weather for testing).</p>

Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a> The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.  </p>
