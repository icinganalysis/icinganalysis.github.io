<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The convective heat transfer from the surface of a conical forebody
having a hemispherical nose, an included angle of approximately 30°, and
a maximum diameter of 18.9 inches was investigated in a wind tunnel for
both stationary and rotating operation. The range of test conditions
included free-stream velocities up to 400 feet per second, rotational
speeds up to 1200 rpm, and. angles of attack of 0° and 6°. Both a uniform
surface temperature and a uniform heater input power density were used.  </p>
<p>The Nusselt-Reynold's number relations provided good correlation of
the heat-transfer data for the complete operating range at 0° angle of
attack with and without spinner rotation, and for 6° angle of attack with
rotation. Rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm had no apparent effect on the
heat-transfer characteristics of the spinner. The results obtained at
6° angle of attack with rotation were essentially the same as those obtained 
at 0° angle of attack without rotation. The experimental heat-transfer 
characteristics in the turbulent flow region were consistently
in closer agreement with the results predicted for a two-dimensional body
than with those predicted. for a cone. For stationary operation at 6°
angle of attack, the measured heat-transfer coefficients in the turbulent
flow region were from 6 to 13 percent greater on the lower surface (wind-ward 
side) than on the upper surface (sheltered side) for corresponding
surface locations. The spinner-nose geometry appeared to cause early
boundary-layer transition. Transition was initiated at a fairly constant 
Reynolds number (based on surface distance from nose) of 8.0X10^4.
Transition was completed at Reynolds numbers less than 5.0x10^5 for all
conditions investigated.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>Fundamental information on the heat-transfer and boundary-layer
characteristics of stationary and rotating simple bodies of revolution
is needed to design icing protection systems for all-weather aircraft.  </p>
<p>Examples of simple three-dimensional bodies used as aircraft components
are radomes, forward sections of external stores, propeller spinners for
turboprop engines, and jet-engine accessory housings. Several theoretical
and experimental heat-transfer studies have been maie for such bodies,
but the data are generally limited to specific problems, such as supersonic flight, 
small or zero angles of attack, or zero rotational speeds.  </p>
<p>As part of a general experimental program conducted at the NACA Lewis
laboratory on icing protection for bodies of revolution, the present investigation 
is a study of the heat transfer from the surface of a conical
forebody in clear air for low subsonic flight speeds, with and without
rotation, and for angle-of-attack operation. This work is an extension
of heat-transfer studies reported in references 1 and 2 for two ellipsoidal
bodies of revolution having fineness ratios of 3.0 and 2.5.  </p>
<p>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE  </p>
<p>The study of heat transfer from the surface of a conical forebody
was conducted in the 6- by 9-foot test section of the Lewis icing research
tunnel. Figure 1 is a photograph of the model installed in the tunnel.
The faired afterbody and its related equipment for obtaining temperature
and pressure measurements with rotation is the same as that used in previous 
heat-transfer studies of ellipsoids (refs. 1 and 2). The 18.9-inch
maximum diameter of the conical model was faired to the 20-inch minimum
diameter of the afterbody by a transition piece that rotated with the
model.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conical model proper, hereinafter referred to as a "cone" or
"spinner", had an axial length of 35 inches and was constructed of 0.061-
inch aluminum spun to the desired shape. The nose, or apex, of the cone
was rounded to a 1/2-inch radius and the spinner surface was slightly
convex (bulged), deviating from a true conical surface by approximately
0.6 inch at the midpoint. Approximately 1000 square inches of heated
surface area were provided by means of internal electric heaters of the
blanket type. Although the spinner model was not a true cone, it was
considered adequately representative, especially for a practical installation 
employing blanket-type heaters. It should be stated that the model,
supplied by the U. S. Air Force, was not designed and built for the specific 
purpose of obtaining detailed basic heat-transfer information, but
rather was a production article in many respects.    </p>
<p>A schematic drawing of the spinner model, heater layout, details of
heater construction, and thermocouple cross-sectional locations are shown
In figure 2. The thermocouples located within the heater proper were
used to determine heat losses to the cone interior.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Method of Analysis  </p>
<p>The heat flow paths assumed for the calculations are shown in figure 3.
The external convective heat-transfer coefficient h was evaluated on
the basis of an effective local heat dissipation from the external surface, 
neglecting in most cases longitudinal and circumferential heat
conduction through the model skin
Qal, but in all cases accounting for
heat loss to the cone interior Qi. The heat loss to the interior of the
model was determined from the relation  </p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>Velocity Distribution  </p>
<p>The velocity distribution over the surface of the cone for zero rotation 
is presented in figure 4(a) in terms of the ratio of local to free-stream 
velocity Us/U0 for three angles of attack. For the conditions
investigated, the sharp peak in velocity occurred at a constant value of
0.7 inch from the spinner nose, which corresponds to the point at which
the cone body becomes tangent to the hemispherical nosecap. The shift in
air stagnation point was found to be very small (less than 1/8 inch at
6°) and was neglected in computations involving local surface distance.
The theoretically predicted velocity distribution (ref. 9) for a true 15°
half-angle cone at 0° angle of attack is presented for comparison with
experimental results. Measurements in a meridional plane midway between
the upper and lower surfaces for 6° angle of attack (stationary) showed
local velocities in this plane to be only 1.5 to 3.0 percent lower than
those obtained for the upper, or sheltered, surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. Velocity distribution over spinner surface." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-4093%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Velocity distributions with spinner rotation are presented in figure
4(b) for 0°, 3°, and 6° angles of attack. These curves are for the maximum 
rotational speed and minimum free-stream velocity investigated (1200
rpm and 255 ft/see, respectively). The results show that, with spinner
rotation, velocity distribution is rather insensitive to small changes
in angle of attack. In addition, comparison of figures 4(b) and 4(a)
shows that rotation at 0° angle of attack caused a maximum increase in
local velocity of only about 5 percent at the rear of the spinner.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typical results. - Typical data obtained at 00 angle of attack with
uniform heat input (nonuniform surface temperature) are presented in figure 5 
in terms of the surface temperature rise ts - td and the convective 
heat-transfer coefficient h for two values of input power density.
The data (from nonconsecutive runs) are for a stationary spinner and
exemplify the general characteristics and repeatability of results for
the condition of uniform heat input.   </p>
<p>Also shown in figure 5 is the variation of effective heater power
density (input power minus loss to the cone interior) with surface distance 
from the nose. The decrease in effective heater power density with
increasing surface distance is indicative of the heat loss to the cone
interior since the input density was essentially uniform. The internal
heat loss ranged from a minimum of approximately 3 percent to a maximum
of about 10 percent of the total heat input. The rate of heat loss to
the cone interior increased steadily with increasing surface distance from
the nose except for heaters A and B, where measured temperatures indicated
negligible internal heat loss in all cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the present
model, however, the hemispherical nosecap extends to only about 75° from
stagnation, at which point it attaches to the conical body. Hence, for
the data presented in figure 6 (Re d l.8xl05 ), the maximum extent of
laminar flow probably cannot exceed Re 5 i05 (local surface Reynolds
number corresponding to 75° on the nosecap). Although initiation of
transition appears to result from the nature of the flow about the nosecap, 
the abrupt change in pressure gradient probably destabilizes the
boundary layer further and thus completes transition in a relatively
short distance. For higher free-stream velocities, the laminar region
may be expected to be even less than that noted for the data in figure 6.<br>
Because the region of laminar flow was extremely small, the heat-transfer 
results for this region were limited to data obtained from a
single measuring station (data for Re 8 = 7.3x104 , fig. 6). These data
cannot adequately describe the heat transfer in the laminar region and,
hence, the order of agreement between experimental and. predicted results
cannot be definitely stated. Although the results appear to agree quite
well with predicted values, this fact may be fortuitous in view of the
nature of the heat-transfer results previously described for the nose
section, that is, essentially constant values of heat-transfer coefficient
and surface temperatures. Because the measured surface temperatures were
always practically constant for heater A area (even for the case of uniform 
heat input), the theoretical results of reference 3 were determined
on the basis of uniform surface temperature only.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>An experimental wind-tunnel investigation of heat transfer from the
surface of a conical forebody (18.9-in. maximum diameter) operating under
stationary, rotating, and angle-of-attack conditions yielded the following
results:<br>
1. Good correlation of th heat-transfer results was obtained by use
of the Nusselt-Reynolds number relation for the complete operating range
investigated for 0° angle of attack with and. without spinner rotation,
and. for angles of attack up to 6° with rotation.<br>
2. Rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm had no apparent effect on the
heat-transfer characteristics of the spinner. The heat-transfer data at
angle of attack with rotation were essentially the same as those obtained
at 0° angle of attack without rotation.<br>
3. Heat-transfer results in the region of turbulent boundary-layer 
flow were consistently in closer agreement with the values predicted
for two-dimensional bodies than with those predicted for a cone.<br>
4. For stationary operation at 6° angle of attack, the measured
values of heat-transfer coefficient in the turbulent region were from 6.0
to 13.0 percent less on the sheltered side (upper surface) than those on
the windward side (lower surface) for corresponding surface locations.<br>
5. Early boundary-layer transition occurred for all conditions investigated. 
Transition was initiated at a fairly constant value of local
Reynolds number (based on surface distance from nose) of 8.0X10^4. In all
cases, the transition from laminar to turbulent flow was completed at
Reynolds numbers less than 5.0X10^5.  </p>
