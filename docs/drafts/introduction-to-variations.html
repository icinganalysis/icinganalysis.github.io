<h3>Differences in ice shapes between test and analysis</h3>
<p>The most detailed comparison data to date is based on the 
slightly different, prior definition in NASA-CR-1999-208690 "Validation Results for LEWICE 2.0" 
<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990021235">ntrs.nasa.gov</a>:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 16. Max. Thickness Angle on Sample Ice Shape." src="/images%2FNASA-CR-1999-208690%2FFigure%2016.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Max. Ice Thickness (Horns)  </p>
<p>The details of the ice thickness calculation were
presented in the section on Description of Comparison Method. 
As discussed in this section, the measurement of a max. thickness is not necessarily the
thickness of a glaze ice horn. Where the ice shape
does have a glaze ice horn, the max. thickness does
give the horn thickness. In order to compare different
conditions with different chord lengths and accretion
conditions, the individual ice thicknesses were non-dimensionalized by the maximum accumulation 
thickness as given in Equation 3.<br>
<img alt="Equation 3." src="/images%2FNASA-CR-1999-208690%2FEquation%203.png"><br>
Figure 19 shows the dimensionless difference in
ice thickness for the three ice thickness measurements made in this report. 
Results are presented for
the variation of tunnel repeatability, spanwise variability, 
tracing error as well as for the overall experimental error and for LEWICE. 
This figure shows that
the max. thicknesses can be measured to within 5%
and that the average difference between LEWICE
and the experimental average value is 11% for max.
thickness.  </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 19. Variation of Ice Thickness Compared to Average Experimental Value." src="/images%2FNASA-CR-1999-208690%2FFigure%2019.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Angle at Max. Thickness (Horn Angle)  </p>
<p>As described earlier, the horn angle was measured 
with respect to a horizontal line which goes
through the center of the inscribed cylinder at the
leading edge. This angle was measured for all ice
shapes whether or not they fit the classical definition
of having a glaze ice horn. Many experimental ice
shapes were in the form of distributed roughness
with several peaks which can cause a large amount
of scatter in the experimental results shown.  </p>
<p>Figure 21 shows the variation between the max.
thickness angle for LEWICE and for the experimental
average value as well as the variation for individual
experimental ice shapes to the same average using
the categories described earlier. Results are presented in degrees. 
This figure shows that the variation in the experimental
data is 6 degrees for the
upper angle, 10 degrees for the lower angle and 13
degrees for the difference between these angles. The
LEWICE difference from the experimental average
are 16 degrees for the upper angle, 30 degrees for
the lower angle and 33 degrees for the angle difference.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>An overall average of the difference factors was proposed. 
However, this has not seen wide adoption, so it is not detailed here. 
There is a figure of a comparison example that approximates the average differences. </p>

<p>LEWICE (2D) is the only code that I know of that has been characterized to this level of detail.  </p>
<p>Note that the characterization method and data are largely for two-dimensional geometries. 
While detail-rich, 3D scans have been made of ice shapes, 
including scalloped horns on swept wings,
general characterizations of 3D geometries have not yet been well-developed.  </p>
<h3>Variations in analysis methods</h3>
<p>AC 20-73A:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>R.5.4 Drop Impingement and Ice Accretion Computer Codes and Other Analytical Methods.<br>
Applicants may use verified computer codes and analytical methods to predict ice shapes. The
predicted ice shape is the result of calculations that define the flowfield, the drop trajectories,
water loading, and the ice accretion physics. Many icing codes are available. They differ to
varying degrees in their manner of modeling the ice accretion process. SAE ARP5903
(Reference R20) provides information that describes several available drop impingement and ice
accretion codes.  </p>
<p>Confidence in 2D icing codes to predict ice shapes accurately is mixed when their results are 
compared with icing wind tunnel ice. Figures R-21 through R-24 show reasons for this mixed 
confidence. The figures compare ice shapes predicted by several icing codes with those 
produced in two icing wind tunnels. The data from Reference R21 show that even at colder, 
rime ice conditions, where confidence in predicted ice shapes is highest, there are significant 
differences between predicted and empirical ice shapes.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure R-21. Comparison of Drop Impingement and Ice Accretion Code Results With Experimental Ice
Accretion Produced in the NASA IRT (V = 135.8 kts, T S = -15.8°C, LWC = 1.16 g/m 3 ,

chord = 0.9144 m) (Reference R21)." src="/images%2Fac2073a%2FFigure%20R-21.png">  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the results from the codes differ from one another and from the test ice shape, 
at least some may be viewed as "conservative" (if not particularly accurate), 
in that the horn thickness determined by analysis is greater than that from test. 
Several of the codes have purportedly been used for certification work. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reasons why ice shapes produced by various icing wind tunnels, computer codes, and other
analytical methods may vary include:<br>
- Calibration of the icing wind tunnel.<br>
- The uniformity and qualities of the tunnel’s flow and icing cloud.<br>
- Other tunnel testing considerations.  </p>
<p>Reasons why ice shapes produced by various ice accretion computer codes, and other analytical
methods, vary include:<br>
- Differing algorithms and assumptions used in the computer codes and analytical
methods.<br>
- The use of various computer code versions and inputs.<br>
- The use of empirical ice shapes from different sources to “tune” computer codes and
other analytical methods (to account for unknown icing physics and other effects).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For several recent ice shape comparison examples, including 3D codes (and the codes identified), see 
"AIAA 1st Ice Prediction Workshop Results post-processing for code-to-code comparison" 
<a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/richahan/IPW/files/IPW1/Presentations/IPW1_Presentations/Day%201/IPW_Code2CodeComparison_final.pdf">folk.ntnu.no</a>. 
The differences between codes have not reduced much since AC 20-73A was published in 2008.  </p>
<h3>Trends of ice shape effects</h3>
<p>Some general studies of ice shape effects have been published. 
These have been largely for 2D geometries. 
They have also generally been at lower Reynolds number values, 
and Reynolds effects can influence results. </p>
<p>The effects are unique for each airfoil.
On an airplane level, 
where many wings have sweep, twist, and taper, 
results can be configuration specific, and the general correlations do not take those into account. 
Results can be sensitive to the Reynolds and Mach number values. 
These and other factors limit the general applicability of using these 
data to other airfoils and flight conditions. </p>
<p>While the general data may not give accurate absolute values, 
they have been used to inform engineering judgment to identify 
among many possible candidates the 
ice shape most likely to have the largest effects. </p>
<p>Some studies have placed protuberances on the airfoil, and measured the effects. 
This may relate well to the effect of an upper surface ice horn.  </p>
<p>AC 20-73A:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>R.4.2 Aerodynamic Considerations for Determining Critical Ice Shapes.  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Figure R-12 shows low Reynolds number wind tunnel test results. These data resulted from
installing a 1⁄4-inch simulated ice shape (quarter-round) at various chordwise locations on 18-inch
models of each airfoil. Figure R-13 shows the maximum lift values. Although these
aerodynamic characteristics are Reynolds number dependent, the data show where the ice builds
up is important and show the influences of the ice buildup on the behavior of the boundary layer
and the airfoil aerodynamic performance.  </p>

considered other heights and found that:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aerodynamic penalties became more
sever[e] as the height-to-chord ratio of the simulated ice shape was increased from .0056 to .0139. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data appears to support that an ice "horn" can be approximated as a protuberance, 
as the shape of the protuberance had only minor effects:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variation in the simulated ice shape geometry had only minor effects on the airfoil aerodynamics.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other data also show that the height of a protuberance (H/C) as well as location can affect performance. 
"Airfoil Section Characteristics as Affected by Protuberances" NACA-TR-446, <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19930091520">ntrs.nasa.gov</a> 
shows trends with height that can be non-linear, and are dependent on position for the NACA0012 airfoil:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 13. Variation of maximum lift with protuberance height. Protuberance on upper surface." src="/images%2Fnaca-tr-446%2FFigure13.png"><br>
<em>From NACA-TR-446.</em>  </p>
<p>For larger airfoils, all of the ice may be in the first few percent of X/C, 
and any "horns" farther forward, virtually at X/C=0 (for the base of the horn). 
So, in the figure above, 
the effect on lift may increase with height up to a point for X/C near zero, 
but had little increase for H/C &gt; 0.005.  </p>
<p>See the blog post <a href="https://icinganalysis.com/conclusions-of-the-ice-shapes-and-their-effects-thread.html">"Conclusions of the Ice Shapes and Their Effects Thread"</a> 
for several other examples of general correlations. </p>
<h3>Relating LEWICE variations to effects on lift</h3>
<p>We can compare the effect on lift noted in NACA-TR-446 of protuberances on a NACA0012 airfoil 
with the average difference of calculated upper horn location and thickness for LEWICE calculations compared to test values. </p>
<p>We will use the thickest protuberance in NACA-TR-446, H/C = 0.0125, as this is the easiest to see when plotted. </p>
<p>The values from the figure above are mapped around the airfoil in fairly small increments of Cl max value. 
Linear interpolation was used. </p>
<p>The tested protuberance locations are shown, 
and a LEWICE upper horn tolerance box drawn around that "horn". 
The LEWICE angular position tolerance is +/- 16 degrees, 
so the size of the tolerance box varies with distance from the center of curvature. 
It was also assumed that the maximum ice thickness equals the potential accumulation 
(equation 3 of NASA/CR-1999-208690), 
which determines the ice height tolerance (+/- 11% of the potential accumulation). 
The actual ice horn height is typically less than the potential accumulation 
(but can also be greater), 
so the height tolerance depicted is not accurate for all cases; 
it is intended as an order-of-magnitude illustration only.  </p>
<p><img alt="NACA0012 sensitivity." src="/images%2FIntermediate%2FNACA0012%20sensitivity_zoom.png"><br>
<em>Public Domain image by Donald Cook.</em>  </p>
<p>For the protuberance at the X/C = 0 location, 
neither the location nor the thickness tolerance would have a large effect, 
with the interpolated Cl values close to the nominal 0.87. </p>
<p>For the X/C = 0.05 location, the Cl values range from 0.42 to 0.70 about the nominal 0.5 value. 
However, I reviewed dozens of NACA0012 ice tracings, 
and I did not find one with an ice "horn" back as far as X/C = 0.05, 
so this may not be a very applicable comparison.  </p>
<p>The data from DOT/FAA/AR-00-14 for the effect of protuberances on the 23102m airfoil 
is further described in Lee, 2001 <a href="http://icing.ae.illinois.edu/papers/01/sam%20lee%20phd%20dissertation.pdf">icing.ae.illinois.edu</a>. 
We can use that data to make a plot similar to that for the NACA0012 airfoil. </p>
<p><img alt="23012m sensitivity." src="/images%2FIntermediate%2F23012m%20sensitivity_zoom.png"><br>
<em>Public Domain image by Donald Cook.</em>  </p>
<p>I did not find a detailed enough data source for the effect on other airfoils to do more comparisons. </p>
<h3>What is a "large" difference in ice shape?</h3>
<p>The answer to the question of what is a "large" difference in ice shape depends on the situation. </p>
<p>One way to address the question is how close you need to be to a performance parameter, 
such as Cl max. If you want to know the effect, for example, to within +/- 5%, 2%, or whatever, 
and you have rich enough data to make a plot such as above, 
you can determine an allowed ice shape tolerance. 
For LEWICE, you can compare that to the expected shape differences. </p>
<p>There are other performance parameters (drag, moment, etc.) of interest 
that may have different from the lift trends noted above.</p>
<p>For other tools, I have not seen the variations as well-defined as for LEWICE. </p>
