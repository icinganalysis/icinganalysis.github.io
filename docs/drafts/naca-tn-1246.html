<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation was made of the icing characteristics and
means of ice protection of a typIcal radial-engine cooling-fan
installation, The investigation was made at various icing and
performance conditions in the icing research tunnel of the NACA
Cleveland laboratory.</p>
<p>The icing of the unprotected cooling-fan installation was
found to present a serious operational problem. Reduction in air
flow below the minimum value required for engine cooling occurred
within 2 minutes and complete stoppage of the cooling-air flow
through the fan assembly occurred in as little as 5 minutes under
normal icing conditions.</p>
<p>Steam de-icing was found to be effective for the cowling lip
and inlet duct. Alcohol de-icing of the fan blades and stator
vanes was found to be unsatisfactory. Electrical heat de-icing
of the fan blades was found to be effective but de-icing of the
stator vanes was not completely effective at the power densities
investigated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This publication is fairly long (40 pages), 
so only selected sections and figures are reproduced here to 
illustrate the results.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>APPARATUS</p>
<p>The investigation was conducted in the diffuser section of the
icing research tunnel. The cooling-fan assembly was mounted on the
modified nose section of an airplane fuselage installed in the tunnel. 
The installation consisted of a typical propeller-speed engine
cooling fan, a stator-vane and diffuser assembly, a baffle plate
located in a constant-area annular duct downstream of the fan to
simulate the pressure drop across the engine, a standard radial-engine 
cowling, a three-blade propeller and spinner, and necessary
instrumentation. (See fig. 1.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Cooling fan. - The cooling-fan assembly was designed to be
mounted at the front face of a radial engine and enclosed by the
engine cowling with the fan rotor attached to the rear of the propeller 
hub and the stator-vane assembly attached to the reduction-gear housing. 
The front fairing of the fan disk was of the "dish-pan" 
type with a large forward bulge at the outer diameter of the
dishpan. The fan bad 72 cambered, sheet-metal blades with a tip
diameter of 43 inches and a tip clearance of three-sixteenths inch.
As part of the cooling-fan assembly, 49 cambered. sheet-metal stator
vanes were located behind the fan to remove the rotational component 
of the flow. A clearance of seven-eighths inch existed between
the fan blades and stator vanes. (See fig. 1.)</p>
<p>Instrumentation. - Total pressure in front of the fan and total
and static pressure behind the stator vanes were measured by
pressure-tube rakes (fig. 2), Four equally spaced rakes of shielded
total-pressure tubes were located at the lip of the engine cowling
between the fan and propeller. These rakes were unheated. because of
the extreme difficulty in heating small shielded total-pressure tubes
and hence were used only on nonicing pressure-distribution studies.
Electrically heated rakes consisting of four total-pressure tubes
and one static-pressure tube were installed behind the stator vanes
at four equally spaced positions corresponding to the positions of
the front rakes. In addition, static pressures were measured on
the inner wall of the diffuser in the plane of the rear rakes. All
the pressures wore indicated on a multiple-tube manometer and were
photographically recorded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steam-heat Installation. - In order to investigate the elimination 
of ice on the engine-cowling lip and the consequent scraping
of the fan-blade tips, one steam line with jets 0.10-inch in diameter 
and spaced 1/2 inch apart was placed inside the cowling lip
and another was located outside the inlet duct 2 inches behind the
first line (fig. 3). These lines were of 3/8-inch copper tubing
and extended approximately 40° on each side of the center line in
the lower half of the cowling. Steam heating was confined to the
lower quarter of the cowling because of time limitations and also
to provide an unheated area for comparison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 3. Location of steam lines in cooling—fan installation." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1246%2FFigure%203.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol de-icing installation, - In the investigation of the 
use of isopropyl alcohol for de-icing, spray nozzle bars were 
mounted radially in front of the fan blades and also between the 
fan blades and the stator vanes (fig. 4), The spray nozzle bars, 
consisting of tubes having six small jets each 0.070 inch. in diameter, 
were mounted to spray the alcohol forward in an attempt to 
obtain a good spray dispersion and at the same time to keep the 
spray tubes de-iced. For the first installation a single nozzle 
bar was mounted horizontally in front of the fan blades and one 
in a corresponding position was mounted at the leading edge of the 
stator vanes. For the second installation two spray nozzle bars 
located approximately 45° apart were similarly mounted in front of 
the fan blades and two spray nozzle bars were also mounted at the 
leading edge of the stator vanes, This second configuration was 
used to obtain a greater coverage of alcohol on the stator vanes 
and to accommodate greater flows, A variable-control alcohol
pump provided flow rates up to 2.3 pounds per minute.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. Location of alcohol spray nozzle bars in cooling-fan installation." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1246%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electrical-heat do-icing installation. - The use of electric
heaters for de-icing was confined to the fan blades and stator
vanes, as shown in figure 5. Because of the large number of blades
and the anticipated large power requirements, only a few of the
blades were so heated. The blade heaters were similar to propeller-blade 
de-icing heaters and consisted cf parallel chordwise
electrical resistance wires enclosed, between two layers of neoprene
cemented to cover the entire chord of both blade faces. Because the
heaters were rectangular, they did not fully protect the inner ends
of the fan-blade leading edges. Heaters were applied to twelve of
the 72 fan blades, arranged in two groups of six consecutive blades
diametrically opposite and to six consecutive stator vanes. The
heated area on each fan blade uas 21.3 square inches with a resistance 
of 12 ohms per blade; the heated area cn a stator vane was
39 square inches with a resistance of 16 ohms per vane.
The power density of the heaters was uniform. The twelve
heaters on the fan blades were connected in series in one circuit
and the six heaters on the stator vanes were also series-connected
in a second circuit. Power to the blade heaters was metered
through a variable resistance and transmitted to the fan through
a slip ring mounted on the propeller hub behind the fan. An electronic 
cycle timer permitted the cyclical application of power to
the blade heaters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calibration of tunnel-Icing conditions. - The icing conditions
were defined by the ambient-air temperature and liquid-water content
of the air. Figure 6 presents the variation of liquid-water content
with air temperature at the face of the cooling fan as determined by
a survey conducted in the diffuser section of the icing research
tunnel and a comparison of these conditions with the values recommended 
by the NACA Subcommittee on De-Icing Problems and. by the
Mt. Washington Weather Bureau meetIng on June 19, 1945. The subcommittee 
values are one-half of the recommended maximum values an1.
are for average or typical icing. Vertical cylinders rotating
about their axes were installed in the diffuser section and, from
measurements of the local velocity and the ice accumulation per
unit time on these cylinders, the average liquid-water content in
grams per cubic meter for each condition of tunnel air velocity,
ambient-air temperature, and spray-water input pressure was computed
by the method of Langmuir of the General Electric Company. Droplet
size was also measured but no consistent correlation with air temperature 
was obtained. An average droplet size of 55 microns was
obtained in the icing research tunnel for the range of air temperature 
of 00 to 32 0 F as compared with the recommended averages of
10 and 30 microns, respectively, at these temperatures. This variation 
in droplet size was not considered important, however,
because the collection efficiency of small objects such as th.e thin
fan blades and stator vanes is known to be very close to 100 percent,
Although the liquid-water concentrations are slightly less than the
recommended values for most of the temperature range, the experimental 
values are nevertheless representative of moderate-to-light
icing conditions encountered in the United States. This survey was
made approximately 3 months before the cooling-fan investigation.
Although time limitations prevented any extensive checks of the
liquid-water content and distribution, visual observations of the
spray cloud and icing of the installation and tunnel, together with
readings of spray-water input pressures, indicated that the icing
conditions were fairly constant and in fairly close agreement with
the indicated values for the cooling-fan investigation. A velocity
survey made after this investigation indicated, however, that the
icing of the contraction section of the tunnel resulted in an
increase in the thickness of the tunnel boundary layer with a 
corresponding increase in the velocity at the center of the tunnel.
In addition to the change in velocity distribution, this increase
in boundary layer also caused some changes in liquid-water content
and distribution.</p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>Icing - Photographs ebowing typical icing of the fan assembly
at the conditions tested are shown in figures 7 to 12, The effects
of icing on fan performance re shown in figures 13 and 14 where
the ratios of the air flow and fan pressure of the iced fan to that
of the fan before icing CQ/CQ0 and CP/CP0, respectively, are plotted
against icing time. Although insufficient data were available to
compare the effects of icing at all icing and performance conditions,
the results shown in figures 13 and 14 are complete enough to define
the effects of icing on fan performance throughout the normal range
of icing and performance conditions, The minimum air flow required
for adequate engine cooling is indicated in figure 13 as computed.

<blockquote>
<p>Steam-heat de-icing, - The results of a brief qualitative 
investigation of the use of steam for de-icing the cowling lip and
inlet duct are shown in figure 15. Figure 15(a) shows the results
of de-icing with a single steam line placed outside the inlet duct
at the tip of the fan blades, The heated area started to throw
off ice 50 seconds after the steam was turned on and all the ice
was removed within 2 minutes with the heated area remaining clear
thereafter. In a delayed de-icing run with the same configuration, 
steam was turned on after 5 minutes of icing and the ice in the |
heated area was thrown off within 30 seconds. With the double steam
line installed (fig.15(b)), a slightly greater area including thé
lip of the engine cowling was de-iced in the same time. From these
results, it appears that the de-icing of these areas by means of
hot gases is entirely feasible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol de-icing, - The results of the use of alcohol sprays
are shown in figures 16 to 20. At an alcohol flow of 0.5 pound
per minute and with the initial spray configurations, fairly good
de-icing of the fan blades was obtained at an air temperature of
13° F end liquid-water content of 0.4 gram per cubic meter (fig. 16).
A fairly heavy accumulation of slush was retained, however, on
several stator vanes that were concave upward.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a higher air
temperature and water content and with the same alcohol flow
(fig. 17), the fan blades were only partly de-iced and all the
stator vanes were partly blocked by similar deposits of slush.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 17. Views showing effect of alcohol de-icing of cooling-fan installation 
at air temperature of 25 F, liquid-water content of 1.0 gram per cubic meter, 
fan speed of 875 rpm, and alcohol flow rate of 0.5 pounds per minute." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1246%2FFigure%2017.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the alcohol flow was increased to 1.2 pounds per minute at
approximately the same icing and speed conditions and with the second 
spray configuration, no improvement in de-icing was apparent
(fig. 18). Although the convex face of the fan blades was almost
completely clear of ice, heavy deposits of slush were as much as 
three-fourths inch thick at the concave-face trailing edge, The
stator vanes again had large formations of wet ice and were approximately 
50-percent blocked. At a medium icing condition (air temperature, 
14° F and liquid-water content, 0.5 gram/cu m) and an alcohol flow 
of 1.5 pounds per minute, the fan blades were almost
fully de-iced. (See fig. 19.)  </p>
<p>Medium formations of wet ice were
found on the stator vanes immediately behind the spray tubes and
only 2 thin coating of ice was found on the rest of the stator
blades, When the alcohol flow was increased to 2.3 pounds per minute, 
the fan blades were again almost completely de-iced (fig. 20).
Large deposits accumulated, however, on all the stator vanes. As
shown by the photographs of all the alcohol de-icing (figs, 16.to 20),
the alcohol-diluted ice thrown off the fan blades impinged on the 
stator vanes where it remained and refroze. For all conditions,
configurations, and flows investigated, the use of alcohol as a
de-icing agent proved ineffective because of the marginal de-icing
of the fan blades and the large ice deposits obtained on the stator
vanes. It is estimated that no practical amount of alcohol would 
satisfactorily preserve fan performance under all icing conditions.</p>
<p>Electrical heat de-icing. - - Photographs showing the results. of
the use of electric blade heaters are presented in figures 21.to 25,
As only a few of the fan blades and stator vanes were heated, no
fan-performance data were obtained. With an air temperature of
15° F, liquid-water content of 0.5 gram per cubic meter, fan speed
of 954 rpm, and a power density of 5 watts per square inch, fairly
complete de-icing of the heated fan blades resulted (See fig, 21.)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The small amount of ice at the root of the leading edge was caused
by ice bridging over from an unheated part of the blade. It should
be noted that the group of heated fan blades behind propeller
blade 1 were partly shielded from icing by the blade shank. The
de-icing of the stator vanes was only marginal with rough ice building 
up near the trailing edge. When the power density was increased
to 6 watts per square inch (fig. 22), some improvement in the de-icing
of the stator vanes resulted but rough ice still collected at the
trailing edge. At a higher temperature and liquid-water content
(fig. 23) complete de-icing of the heated fan blades was obtained
after 5 minutes of icing. The de-icing of the stator vanes was again
marginal. The effects of electrical heating at two icing conditions,
each of 10-minute duration, are shown in figures 24 and 25, Both 
experiments were made at power densities of 6 watts per square inch
with the fan blades almost completely de-iced. At the lower temperature, 
the de-icing of the stator vanes was marginal and at the
higher temperature and liquid-water content, the de-icing of the
stator vanes was completely ineffective.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of an icing investigation of a conventional radial-engine 
cooling-fan installation in the icing research tunnel indicate
that:
1. The icing of the unprotected installation presents a serious
operational problem. Reduction in air flow below the minimum value
required for adequate engine cooling occurred within 2 minutes and
complete stoppage of the cooling-air flow through the fan assembly
occurred within 5 minutes under normal icing conditions.
2. Steam de-icing of the cowling lip and inlet duct showed the
feasibility of hot gas de-icing for this portion of the assembly.
3. Alcohol de-icing of the fan proved to be ineffective and,
in some cases, increased the icing problem by causing large 
formations on the stator vanes.
4. Electrical heat do-icing was the most promising method of
de-icing the blades. The fan blades required a minimum power density
of 6 watts per square inch but for the stator vanes this power
density proved insufficient.</p>
