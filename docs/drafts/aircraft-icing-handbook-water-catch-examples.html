<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The "Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1, provides examples of two-dimensional water catch rates for the ice accretion process. </p>
<p>The Handbook uses something like "US Customary" or "Engineering" units in the calculations. 
This may limit the direct reuse of the equations. </p>
<p>These calculations can be reasonably accomplished through hand calculations, or a spreadsheet. 
However, they can be important "stepping stones" to build more complex capabilities. </p>
<p>Code written in the python programming language is available via 
<a href="https://github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/tree/main/icinganalysis">github.com/icinganalysis</a>, 
file "basics_water_catch_calculations.py" (and associated files) for the solutions, 
under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/main/LICENSE">LGPL license</a>. 
Internally, the code uses (mostly) SI units 
(see <a href="/a-brief-digression-on-unit-systems.html">A Brief Digression on Unit Systems</a> for details). 
There are unit conversion functions in the python code. 
Values here are reported in the handbook units. </p>
<p>You are encouraged to use the provided code, 
or to start building your own library of such calculations 
(that will be far more instructional than just reading this text). 
The examples here may not seem very useful, 
but they provide quick and easy checks for more complex calculations, 
that I have used for decades. 
They are also building blocks used to construct more complex calculations, 
such as those in the "Manual of Scaling Methods" NASA/CR-2004-212875, 2004 <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20040042486/downloads/20040042486.pdf">ntrs</a>.  </p>
<h2>Prerequisite reading</h2>
<p>You should read, at minimum, these sections in the "Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1:  </p>
<p>2.2.1.1 Droplet Trajectory Equation<br>
2.2.1.2 Modified Droplet Inertia Parameter<br>
2.2.1.3 Droplet Impingement Parameters<br>
2.2.1.4 Droplet Size Distribution Effects  </p>
<p>Note that the relevant sections in DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1, 1991 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a> 
were affected by the perhaps little known update in 1993: <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a>. 
The text here is from the updated version. </p>
<p>"Merged" text from the 1991 and 1193 update is available at 
<a href="/drafts/aircraft-icing-handbook-merged-sections.html">Aircraft Icing Handbook Merged Sections</a></p>
<p>There are other sources with comparable information, 
but the notation from the Handbook will be used in the examples below.  </p>
<h3>Example 2-1</h3>
<p>We will illustrate a solution of Example 2-1. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example 2-1<br>
An example of the calculation of Ko for an airfoil is now presented.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Airfoil:              c = 3.1 foot chord - NACA 0012  
Flight Speed:         V = 200 kt (230.16 mph)  
Altitude:             h = 10,000 ft (pressure altitude)  
Ambient Temperature:  T = -4 F = 455.7 R  
Droplet Size:         d = 20 microns    
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>First find the air density and viscosity.
From the pressure altitude, P = 1455.6 psf (10.109 psi). Solve for the air density using</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Example 2-1 rho" src="/images%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FExample%202-1%20rho.png">  </p>
<p>For information on the archaic unit "slug", 
see <a href="/a-brief-digression-on-unit-systems.html#slug">A Brief Digression on Unit Systems</a>.  </p>
<p>A minor point is that DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 uses an approximation for the viscosity of air.<br>
"μ" is the dynamic viscosity of air. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For viscosity, one can use the approximate relation:  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gives a result that is about 3.5% different from the viscosity equation used by 
<a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Langmuir</a>, 
which is a better approximation (using η for viscosity):   </p>
<p><img alt="equation13 for mu." src="/images%2FMathematical%20Investigation%20of%20Water%20Droplet%20Trajectories%2Fequation13.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now calculate Re and K.<br>
In these units Re is given by  </p>
<p><img alt="Example 2-1 re" src="/images%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FExample%202-1%20re.png"></p>

<h3>Example 2-2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Example 2-2<br>
This example illustrates the estimation of the impingement parameters E, β, h, Su and SL
using graphical data (reference 2-12). The graphical data is all presented with Ko as the independent
variable. Much data is available in this form.  </p>
<p>The conditions of Example 2-1 for a NACA 0012 airfoil are assumed: thus Ko = 0.05. It also is
assumed for simplicity that the angle of attack, α, is 0 degrees. From figure 2-11, E, the total
impingement efficiency, is estimated to be 0.23 for these conditions. So about 23 percent of the water
in the projected frontal area of the airfoil, with height h = .120c (found using figure 2-12), impinges
on the airfoil. The maximum impingement efficiency for Ko = 0.05 and a = 0 degrees is estimated
from figure 2-13 to be β_max = 0.68. At a = 0 degrees, the upper and lower limits of impingement are
identical. From figure 2-14 at Ko = 0.05, SU = SL = .04. Therefore, water droplets will impinge on
the airfoil leading edge only back approximately 4 percent of chord. (Note that this example assumes
a "monodispersed" cloud, that is, a cloud in which all the droplets are of the same size. More realistic
approaches are discussed in the following section.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution for E and Beta (only) will be demonstrated here. 
Solving for the impingement limit is similar, 
and is left to the reader as a recommended exercise.</p>
<p>Example 2-2 may be solved graphically:  </p>
<p><img alt="Example 2-2 graphical solution using Figure 2-11." src="/images%2Fbasics%2FFigure%202-11%20Em.png">  </p>
<p>The figure can also be digitized and solved programmatically:  </p>
<p><img alt="Example 2-2 solution using a digitized version of Figure 2-11." src="/images%2Fbasics%2FExample%202-2%20Em.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="Example 2-2 beta.png" src="/images%2Fbasics%2FExample%202-2%20beta.png">  </p>
<h3>Example 2-3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This example is a repetition of Example 2-2 except that this time the impingement parameters
will be found using the entire droplet spectrum. It is assumed that the droplet median volume
diameter (MVD) is 20 im (the droplet size used in Example 2-2) and the cloud droplet spectrum can
be represented by a Langmuir D distribution. The droplet sizes representing the seven size bins in
the distribution are calculated using table I-1 (discussed in Section 1.2.6). Table 2-1 shows the droplet
sizes δ, the proportion δ_v of total droplet volume associated with each δ, and also the values of Re, 
K, and Ko for each δ. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Table 2-1.png" src="/images%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FTable%202-1.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using these values of Ko and figure 2-11, a value E(δ) is associated with each
δ, as shown in the third column of table 2-2. Note that equation 2-23 can also be written as  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Equation 2-25.png" src="/images%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FEquation%202-25.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus E is calculated as an average value of the E(δ) weighted by volume using the Δv's. Table 2-2
shows that a value E = 0.24 is obtained, little different from the value E = 0.23 for the MVD. This
is well within the accuracy of reading numbers from the figure.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Table 2-2.png" src="/images%2FFAA%20Handbook%20volume%201%2FTable%202-2.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considering this droplet size distribution and using equation 2-21, β_max can be calculated for a
surface length location of S = 0 (stagnation point). For the special case of a symmetric airfoil at zero
degrees angle of attack, where β_max occurs at S = 0 for all Ko, equation 2-21 can be used directly to
determine β_max. In table 2-2 the calculation of β_max at S = 0 is summarized in the last two colum's,
obtained from figure 2-11. Here again the value of β_max = 0.65 is close to the value for the MVD
droplet size, where β_max = 0.68.</p>
<p>The maximum limits can be found from Ko,mas and figure 2-14. For the 44.4 micron droplet size,
Ko,max =0.176 and from the figure SU = SL = 0.11, or 11 percent of the chord length.
Estimates of the size of a pneumatic ice protection boot have been made by using an MVD of 20
microns and twice that diameter (40 microns) to determine the maximum extent of significant droplet
catch. This comes to about 10% of the airfoil chord on the critical upper surface.
Ten percent coverage of the upper surface is consistent with statistical measurements of upper surface icing made
in the USSR (reference 2-13). </p>
<p>Comparison of Example 2-2 and 2-3 suggests that, except for the limits of impingement.
impingement parameters calculated using the MVD may give a reasonably good approximation to those
calculated over an entire droplet distribution. </p>
<p>This property of the MVD supplies the main
justification for its wide use as the "representative" droplet size for a supercooled cloud in the study
of aircraft icing. The error introduced in impingement calculations by its use rather than use of the
full droplet spectrum is discussed in reference 2-14 and 2-15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This example could be solved graphically and with by-hand calculations, but that is tedious.
