<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation has been made in the NACA Lewis icing research
tunnel to determine the aerodynamic and icing characteristics of a
full-scale induction-system air-scoop assembly incorporating a flush
alternate inlet. The flush inlet was located immediately downstream of
the offset ram inlet and included a 180° reversal and a 90° elbow in
the ducting between inlet and carburetor top deck. The model also had
a preheat-air inlet. The investigation was made over a range of mass-
air-flow ratios of 0 to 0.8, angles of attack of 0° and 4°, airspeeds
of 150 to 270 miles per hour, air temperatures of 0° and 25° F, various
liquid-water contents, and droplet sizes.  </p>
<p>The ram inlet gave good pressure recovery in both clear air and
icing but rapid blockage of the top-deck screen occurred during icing.
The flush alternate inlet had poor pressure recovery in both clear air
and icing. The greatest decreases in the alternate-inlet pressure
recovery were obtained at icing conditions of low air temperature and
high liquid-water content. No serious screen icing was observed with
the alternate inlet. Pressure and temperature distributions on the carburetor 
top deck were determined using the preheat-air supply with the
preheat- and alternate-inlet doors in various positions. No screen
icing occurred when the preheat-air system was operated in combination
with alternate-inlet air flow.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Selected figures and text will illustrate some conclusions.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The problem of suitably protecting a reciprocating-engine induction
system from icing arose in the design of a large transport airplane.
Throttling and fuel-evaporation icing may be satisfactorily eliminated
by the methods outlined in reference 1. The induction-system icing
problem can therefore be confined to impact icing of the air scoop, the
ducts, the carburetor screen, and the air-metering parts. Impact icing
may be effectively prevented by heating the charge-air supply or by
preventing free water from entering the induction system.</p>
<p>Nearly all aircraft induction systems employ some type of alternate 
inlet to provide a sheltered- or heated-air supply. In the aforementioned 
design problem the heated air supply, although heating the
inlet air sufficiently to prevent icing, did not provide the pressure
recovery required for the critical engine operation conditions. An
alternate inlet based on the principle of inertia separation and careful 
aerodynamic design can effectively eliminate impact icing of the
induction system and at the same time preserve the required ram-recovery
performance. An example of such a system using an under-cowling scoop
is reported in reference 2. Another type of inlet employing the 
inertia-separation principle is the flush or recessed inlet. Such inlets have
been used to obtain ice-free fuel-cell vents (ref. 3).</p>
<p>In the present design, a flush alternate inlet located immediately
downstream of the primary offset ram inlet was used. The duct from the
alternate inlet included a 180° reversal and a 90° elbow before leading
to the carburetor; thus, a region of secondary-inertia separation was
provided (figs. 1 and 2). In order to evaluate the performance of such
an induction system in icing conditions, an investigation of a full-scale 
model was conducted in the icing research tunnel at the NACA Lewis
laboratory. The objectives of the investigation were to determine the
icing characteristics of the system, the aerodynamic performance of the
alternate inlet, and the performance of combined operation of the ram-,
alternate-, and preheat-air supply systems. Pests were conducted over
a range of airspeeds from 150 to 270 miles per hour, angles of attack
of 0° and 4°, tunnel-air temperatures of 0° and 25° F, and mass-air-flow
ratios of 0 to 0.8 on various system configurations for both clear-air
and icing conditions.</p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Ram-Inlet Tests</p>
<p>Clear air. - The variation of the average top-deck pressure recovery 
eta_av with the inlet mass-air-flow ratio in clear air is presented
in figure 5(a). These results were obtained, at an airspeed of approximately 
200 miles per hour, a tunnel-air total temperature of 25° F, and
angles of attack of 0° and 4°. Excellent ram recovery was obtained over
the entire range of mass-air-flow ratios tested, the performance at an
angle of attack of 4° being slightly better than at 0°.  </p>
<p>Icing. - The performance of the rain-inlet system in icing conditions
is shown by the results of figures 5(b) and 5(c). Although only limited
data were obtained, the effect of icing on the top-deck average pressure 
recovery (fig. 5(b)) was almost negligible, being approximately the
same for a three-fold increase in liquid-water content. The pressure
distribution across the top-deck remained essentially uniform and the
pressure-recovery measurements indicate the effect of inlet and duct-wall 
icing rather than screen icing because the pressure tubes extended
above the top-deck screen. The much greater effect of the mass flow is
shown in figure 5(c). The carburetor screen was almost completely
blocked by ice, which caused reductions in the mass flow of approximately 
60 to 90 percent. Very poor pressure recovery would, of course,
be obtained downstream of the blocked screen. The immediate decrease
in the mass flow shown in figure 5(c) resulted from the limited capacity
of the exhaust blower wIiich did not allow a constant flow rate to be
maintained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Photographs of ice on the ram inlet and the carburetor screen at
the end of the icing periods are shown in figure 6. At the higher
liquid-water-content condition (fig. 6(a)), a rough-glaze-ice formation
which built outward from the inlet was obtained on the rain-Inlet lips.
Little or no ice was observed inside the rain duct. Downstream of the
ram inlet, almost the entire scoop including the alternate-inlet ramp
was covered by a frost-like formation. This frost icing is believed to
result from a combination of super saturation in the tunnel and turbulent 
deposit of small drops caused by the presence of rough ice formations 
on the ram-inlet lips. A small semiglaze formation was obtained
on the alternate-inlet lip. The formations on the alternate inlet were
symmetrical. A heavy glaze ice almost completely blocked the screen;
the heated total-pressure tubes maintained small areas ice-free. The
screen icing was somewhat heavier at the rear than at the front of the
top deck. At the low liquid-water condition (fig. 6(b)), the ram-
inlet-lip ice consisted of a dense rime formation which built toward
the center of the inlet in contrast to that at the higher water-content
condition. Icing of the alternate inlet was very similar to that previously 
observed. A very slight icing of the ram duct and elbow was
obtained. Heavy screen icing again occurred, with more ice deposited
at the rear than at the front of the top deck. The difference between
the two types of ice formed at the same air temperature fs attributed
to the greater rate of collection that exists when the liquid-water
content is high and the droplet diameters are large; the greater heat
of fusion obtained under these conditions caused the rough glaze
formation.</p>

<p>Alternate-Inlet Tests</p>
<p>The ice obtained. after 45 minutes of icing at a temperature of
0° F is shown in figure 13. The external icing was similar to that of
figure 12(c), but considerably greater. The frost formations also
increased and indicate clearly the nature of the air flow at the alternate 
inlet. A considerable deposit of ice formed at the center of the
elbow of the alternate duct. The rearward build-up of the ice nodules
on the upper duct indicates a reverse air flow in this region. The
screen icing resulted in very slight blocking except at the center In
the region of the blank representing the carburetor altitude compensator.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</p>
<p>In an investigation of the aerodynamic and icing characteristics
of a flush alternate-inlet induction-system air scoop, the following
results were obtained:<br>
1. The ram inlet gave good pressure recovery as measured upstream
of the carburetor top-deck screen in both clear air and icing conditions.
Rapid blockage of the carburetor top-deck screen was obtained during
icing conditions.<br>
2. The flush alternate inlet had poor pressure recovery characteristics 
over most of the inlet cross section for all conditions investigated 
in both clear air and icing conditions. No serious screen icing
was obtained at the alternate inlet, even in those regions in which
relatively good local pressure recovery occurred. The effects of icing
on the pressure recovery are believed to result primarily from icing on
the inlet lip and frost-like formations on the inlet ramp. The greatest
effects of icing on the pressure recovery were obtained at conditions
of low air temperature or high liquid-water content; at these conditions,
the greatest ramp icing occurred. Variation of angle of attack from
0° and 4° gave no significant change in the alternate-inlet performance
during icing.<br>
3. A uniform temperature distribution across the top deck was
obtained when only preheat air was used.<br>
4. When preheat air was used with modulated alternate-inlet air
flow, the pressure recovery showed no significant improvement over that
obtained with alternate-air flow alone. A fairly uniform temperature
distribution at the top deck was obtained. Icing had no effect on the
top-deck pressure recovery and temperature, and no screen icing resulted.<br>
5. Opening both alternate-air and preheat-air doors simultaneously
provided a combination of ram-, preheat-, and alternate-air flow that
gave fairly good pressure recovery, but poor top-deck temperature distribution 
resulted when these doors were not wide open. A good temperature 
distribution was obtained at the expense of poor pressure recovery
when the doors were wide open.</p>
