<h1>"Comparison of Three Multicylinder Icing Meters and Critique of Multicylinder Method" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Multicylinder instruments had good agreement for liquid water content and median effective drop diameter, 
but poor agreement for the distribution type.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Three multicylinder instruments had good agreement for liquid water content and median effective drop diameter, 
but poor agreement for the distribution type</li>
<li>The Langmuir drop size distributions were revised (but the revised versions were not widely adopted)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Three multicylinder cloud meters, fundamentally similar but differing 
in important details, were compared in use at the Mount Washington
Observatory. Determinations of liquid water content were found to agree
within the limits of the probable error, but the two instruments designed
by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics indicated larger drop
sizes than did the Observatory's instrument, apparently because of
spurious ice catch on the rather rough surface of the larger cylinders.
Comparisons of drop-size distribution were largely indeterminate.  </p>
<p>In a critique of the method, the probable error of determination of
liquid water content was found to be ±8 percent; of drop size, ±6 percent;
and of drop-size distribution, about ±0.7 unit of the modulus of distribution. 
Of the systematic errors, run-off of unfrozen water is most
important, blow-off and erosion seldom being hampering.  </p>
<p>Revision of collection-efficiency computations for cylinders in
clouds with distributed drop sizes was found necessary and also revision
of one of the correction-factor graphs heretofore used. The assumption
of constant ice density in deriving cylinder size was found to be permissible 
for cylinders 1 inch or more in diameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Instrument comparisons</h3>
<p>Three multicylinder instruments were compared over several icing conditions measured at Mount Washington 
(a weather observatory situated at the top of a mountain). The instruments were similar, but not identical, 
with the largest cylinder diameter of 4.5 inch.</p>
<p><img alt="Multicyllnder cloud meters used in comparative study at
Mount Washington Observatory" src="images/naca-tn-2708/figure_1.png"></p>
<p>The LWC values from the three instruments (designate A, B, and O sets) agree well.</p>
<p><img alt="Liquid water content determined by A and B sets correlated
with simultaneous determinations by 0 set" src="images/naca-tn-2708/figure_2_lwc_comparison.png"></p>
<p>The drop size values agree well.</p>
<p><img alt="Drop diameters determined by A and B sets correlated
with simultaneous determinations by 0 set" src="images/naca-tn-2708/figure_3_mvd_comparison.png"></p>
<p>However, the distributions indicated do not agree well.</p>
<p><img alt="Drop-size distributions determined by A and B sets
correlated with simultaneous determinations by 0 set." src="images/naca-tn-2708/figure_4_distribution_comparison.png"></p>
<p>To me, this is the strongest indication we have seen so far in the cylinder thread 
that the drop size distributions are hard to determine accurately with the multicylinder method. 
As noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the cylinders
are small and the speed of flight is high, very great accuracy of observation 
will be required to yield any significant values of drop-size
distribution; at low airspeeds and with large cylinders, the determination 
should be relatively good.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The air speeds in this study were all relatively low (a maximum of 33.1 m/s) 
compared to most of the flight test data we have seen (160 to 230 mph, 70 to 100 m/s), 
where the water catch efficiency on a 4.5 inch diameter 
cylinder should have strongly differentiate values based on distribution type, 
and yet the distribution type determined did not 
correlate well. Other values, such as LWC and MVD, did correlated well, 
indicating that the three instruments received substantially similar exposures to the icing conditions.  </p>
<h3>The Langmuir drop size distributions were revised</h3>
<p>Based on a detailed analysis of the Houghton and Radford <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> data used to develop the Langmuir distributions, 
the distributions were revised:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the course of earlier work on the physical origin of the drop-
size distribution in clouds, the volume distribution diagram of Houghton
and Radford (reference 13) for fog drops was redrawn in the form shown 
in figure 6 and the volume distribution found by Vonnegut, Cunningham,
and Katz (reference 11) in clouds was plotted on the same chart. Upon
comparing this chart with Langmuir's tables (reference 7), it was found
that his selections of the representative radii for the various sub-divisions 
of the volume were in error. The matter was not pursued further 
at the time, but as a part of the present study it was decided to
investigate the effect this error might have on the collection-efficiency
graphs, based on Langmuir's data, that have been used by virtually all
workers with the multicylinder method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "(reference 7)" above is <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, table IX of
Langmuir's paper was revised and expanded to include the broader distributions 
that had been added later by Clark, and is presented here as
Table IV. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revised distributions are purported to be a better approximation of a normal distribution. 
This will be examined in an upcoming post, "A Langmuir B drop size distribution is (almost) a normal distribution". </p>
<p><img alt="Table IV. Ratios of Drop Radius to Volume Median Radius Corresponding to Percentile Divisions of Total Liquid Water in Clouds" src="images/naca-tn-2708/table_iv_corrected_distrbutions.png"> </p>
<p>The revised distributions did not see much use for aviation, 
as neither of the the NACA publications that cite NACA-TN-2708 use the revised distributions. 
(They may have seen some use in meteorological publications <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collection efficiencies corresponding to the revised
volume distributions were computed at KØ = 1000 and are shown in
Table V and Figure 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are relatively small adjustments to the Langmuir and Blodgett values. </p>
