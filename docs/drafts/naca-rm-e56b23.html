<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Heating requirements for satisfactory cyclic de-icing over a wide
range of icing and operating conditions have been determined for a gas-heated, 
36° swept airfoil of 6.9-foot chord with a partial-span leading-edge slat. 
Comparisons of heating requirements and effectiveness were
made between the slatted and unslatted portions of the airfoil. Studies
were also made comparing cyclic de-icing with continuous anti-icing, and
cyclic de-icing systems with and without leading-edge ice-free parting
strips. De-icing heat requirements were approximately the same with either 
heated or unheated parting strips because of the aerodynamic effects
of the 36° sweep angle and the spanwise saw-tooth profile of leading-edge
glaze-ice deposits. Cyclic de-icing heat-source requirements were found
to be one-fourth or less of the heat requirements for complete anti-icing.
The primary factors that affected the performance of the cyclic de-icing
heating system were ambient air temperature, heat distribution, and thermel lag.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>In addition to icing on a highly swept wing, 
this publication illustrates methods of ice protection for a 
moving leading-edge slat. 
Cyclic de-icing versus anti-icing is also covered.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The NACA Lewis laboratory has studied several hot-gas icing protection 
systems in order to obtain data useful in the design of such systems
(refs. 1 to 4). In some of these studies, the technique of cyclic deicing 
was investigated to determine the heat-flow savings that result
from intermittent heating of a portion of an airfoil surface subject to
icing as compared with continuous heating of the surface. In evaluating
the heat-flow savings resulting from cyclic de-icing, the airfoil drag
caused by the ice formations that accrue on the surfaces between heating
periods must be considered. The drag penalties for several airfoil
shapes and ice-protection techniques have already been obtained (refs.
3, 5, 6, and 7), including the drag study (ref. 5) of the airfoil model
used in the present investigation.</p>
<p>In the present study, the heat requirements and effectiveness of a
hot-gas cyclic de-icing system in a 360-swept-airfoil model with a
leading-edge slat have been investigated. The model utilized an NACA
634-009 airfoil section with a slatted leading edge over only a portion
of the span. This feature was incorporated to compare simultaneously
the heating and icing characteristics of the slatted section with those
of the unslatted airfoil. The model was provided also with both hot gas
and electrically heated strips along the leading edges in order to determine 
the effect of continuously heated ice-free parting strips on deicing performance.</p>
<p>The airfoil model was studied over a range of icing conditions in
the NACA Lewis laboratory icing tunnel. Ice-removal data were obtained
for the swept-back model, and a study was made of the special problems
associated with de-icing of a movable leading-edge slat. The model,
furnished by an aircraft manufacturer, was the first hot-gas cyclic de-icing 
system to be developed for production. In an effort to correct
some heating deficiencies that became evident during the tests, modifications 
of the original internal heating arrangements were made, and
limited data on the over-all effects of these changes were obtained.</p>
<p>MODEL AND EQUIPMENT</p>
<p>The model used in this study (fig. 1) is a constant-section NACA
63A-009 airfoil which spans the 6-foot height of the icing research
tunnel. The leading and trailing edges of the model are swept back at
an angle of 36° to the airstream. The airfoil structure and heating
passages were constructed either perpendicular or parallel to the leading 
edge. However, in this report, chordwise dimensions will be taken
parallel to the airstream and spanwise dimensions parallel to the lead-ing edge. 
The streamwise airfoil chord was 6.9 feet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The airfoil leading-edge section consists of two main parts: an
unslatted or "standard-airfoil" section with a spanwise extent of approximately 
26 inches and a slatted leading-edge section with a spanwise
extent of 44 inches. The relation of the movable slat to the fixed-airfoil 
section behind the slat is shown in figure 2. Slat extension
is normally associated with large angles of attack.</p>
<p>Slat  </p>
<p>The leading-edge slat has a 20-inch chord in the streamwise direction 
(fig. 1(a)). The slat moves forward on tracks and rollers into
the airstream in a direction normal to the leading edge. For the tests,
a hydraulic system moves and holds the slat in any desired forward position. 
The slat tracks are curved so that the extended slat moves on a
circular arc to positions forward of and below the lower surface of the
fixed-airfoil section (fig. 2(a)). The radius of curvature of the tracks
1s approximately 34 inches, and the full movement of the slat is over a
16° central angle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURE  </p>
<p>Range of Conditions</p>
<p>The geometric angle of attack of the airfoil was varied from 0° to 8°
with the slat fully retracted; with the slat extended 8° (half of maximum travel), 
the angle of attack for the airfoil was set at 8°. A study
was also made at an angle of attack of 12° with the slat half extended
(8°) and fully extended (16°). The studies with slat extended were made
at an airspeed of 175 mph.</p>
<p>Procedure for Obtaining Data  </p>
<p>In obtaining data during a de-icing run, the procedure was to establish 
first the tunnel conditions of airspeed and air temperature and
then the heating conditions of both gas flow and gas temperature (at the
cycling valves). The gas flows were stabilized while the cycling valves
were positioned to dump the gas flow into the tunnel. Then, water sprays
were turned on and the cycle timers were started simultaneously to control 
selected icing and heating periods. Generally, the first cycle
started with the icing period and followed with the heating (de-icing)
period.</p>
<p>In order to determine heating requirements, the first few icing
cycles were utilized to adjust the heating rates until satisfactory 
deicing was obtained, For convenience, the heat-on times were adjusted
(with other conditions constant) until satisfactory ice shedding 
performance was obtained.  </p>
<p>Satisfactory de-icing performance was determined by visual observation 
and then the model was photographed at significant moments in the
cycle. The criterion of satisfactory, or marginal, de-icing was selected
as the condition of complete ice removal from an airfoil section as far
aft as the limit of the heatable double skin. This criterion was compromised 
in certain local areas that were inadequately heated, and consequently, 
some ice formations which were local in nature would not shed
and were ignored as much as possible in establishing marginal levels of
heating. This criterion, unavoidably subjective in nature, caused 
considerable scatter in the data.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Heating requirements for satisfactory cyclic de-icing were obtained
over a wide range of icing and operating conditions for a slat and a
standard-airfoil section with and without leading-edge ice-free parting
strips. For the models and conditions studied, the following principal
results were obtained:<br>
1. Cyclic de-icing was compared with anti-icing and found to require
about 25 percent or less of the heat source required for complete anti-icing.<br>
2. De-icing heat requirements were approximately the same with either
heated or unheated parting strips. This resulted from the spanwise flow
component associated with swept wings, which helped remove ice by blowing
parallel to the leading edge and which also caused leading-edge glaze ice
to form in discontinuous spanwise saw-tooth pieces that broke up and shed
readily without need of a parting strip. <br>
3. Cyclic de-icing heat requirements increase markedly with decrease
in the datum air temperature. Negligible or inconsistent effects on heat
requirements were found for the following variables: angle of attack,
slat position, airspeed, and liquid-water content. An increase in heating
rates was required with an increase in the icing period of the cycle.<br>
4. The heating time required to shed ice formations near the lead-ing 
edge was several seconds longer than that required to elevate the
surface temperatures to 32° F. Toward the aft end of the heated area,
the ice shed when surface temperatures were close to 32° F. At high rates
of heating, the ice would tend to shed almost simultaneously over the
whole heated lower surface of the standard airfoil.<br>
5. Several localized areas of the model were extremely slow in shedding 
ice because of insufficient heating at these points. Most of these
deficiencies were attributed to the structural complexity inherent with
leading-edge slats and illustrate the need for providing uniform 
surface-temperatures over the model during the heating period.<br>
6. The modified version of the model, without parting strips and with
improved insulation and flow distribution, required less heat-source capacity 
than the original version by about 40 percent. The cyclic heat-source
requirements of the unswept gas-heated, 12-percent-thick airfoil of reference 2 
were approximately between the requirements of the present original and modified 
models. More uniform surface-temperatures and smaller
D-duct gas-temperature losses were obtained with the modified model than
with the original version.</p>

<p>I have seen the effect noted in Result 5 in many tests. 
Ice may not shed until all areas of potential adherence have melted.  </p>
<p>Note also [emphasis added]:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Satisfactory de-icing performance was determined by visual observation 
and then the model was photographed at significant moments in the
cycle. The criterion of satisfactory, or marginal, de-icing was selected
as the condition of complete ice removal from an airfoil section as far
aft as the limit of the heatable double skin. This criterion was compromised 
in certain local areas that were inadequately heated, and consequently, 
<strong>some ice formations which were local in nature would not shed
and were ignored as much as possible in establishing marginal levels of
heating</strong>. This criterion, unavoidably subjective in nature, caused 
considerable scatter in the data.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A difficult part of using cyclical deicing is determining criteria for acceptable performance. 
In NACA-RM-E56B23, the criteria was "unavoidably subjective in nature". 
There is a lot of engineering judgment in determining this, 
and subsequent test data might require revising the judgment. 
What was ignored may turn out to be an important factor.  </p>
