<p>For liquid water to freeze, heat must flow out of the water. 
A term for the amount of heat is the "Latent Heat of Fusion". 
The latent heat value is about 334 kJ/kg. 
This is much higher than the energy required to cool the water by 1°C (1 kJ/kg). </p>
<p>While supercooled water drops in the atmosphere are below 0°C, 
the latent heat release and other energy sources tend to raise an aircraft surface temperature to 0°C 
when water drop impinge on the surface and freeze. </p>
<p>The "Messinger Heat Balance" (from Bernard Messinger in 1951)
considers several ways heat enters and leaves a surface in flight with water on it. 
A large term is the latent heat of freezing. 
Convection heat transfer (the transfer of heat from the surface to the atmosphere due to the motion of air) is a factor considered.
Water on the surface can evaporate, and the evaporation rate is sensitive to air pressure. 
Evaporation greatly aids the freezing process, 
as the latent heat of evaporation is almost seven times (2256 kJ/kg) that of the latent heat of freezing, 
and in opposite sense (freezing produces heat to be removed, evaporation results in cooling). 
Much detailed data, including the water catch rate, is required to perform the Messinger heat balance. </p>
<p>One term that the Messing heat balance produces is a "Freezing Fraction", 
the fraction of impinging water that freezes. 
This can be related to the over-all character of ice shapes. </p>
