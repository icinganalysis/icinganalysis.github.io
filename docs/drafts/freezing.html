<p>The water that causes most aircraft in-flight icing is small drops in clouds. 
Average drop sizes are typically 10 to 50 micrometers in diameter
(for comparison, a human hair is about 50 to 100 micrometers in diameter).</p>
<p>Calculating the amount of water that hits or impinges on the surface 
of an airplane as it flies through a cloud 
is an important step that is required to calculate ice shapes, 
and to determine the amount of ice protection required.</p>
<p>Air flow around an airfoil in flight can be idealized as streamlines, 
which may be parallel far from an object, but bend around an object close to it. 
Mathematical models are available to calculate streamlines. 
Streamlines can be visualized in a wind tunnel using smoke traces 
(a source that makes a thin line of smoke that shows how the airflow bends). </p>
<p>Water drops tend to follow streamlines far from an object, 
but due to their momentum, diverge from streamlines near an object. 
Calculations of the paths of water drops, termed "Water Drop Trajectories", 
are in some ways more complicated than the air flow calculations. 
There is no simple way to directly visualize water drop trajectories. </p>
<p>Streamlines and water drop trajectories around a cylinder 
(airflow is from left to right, or, alternatively, the cylinder is moving from right to left through stationary air and water drops):<br>
<img alt="Figure 1 of NACA-TN-2903, a cylinder in cross flow with air flow lines and water drop trajectories impacting the cylinder" src="/images%2Fcylinder%20with%20flow%20lines.png"><br>
<em>from NACA-TN-2903, 1953.</em>  </p>
<p>As water drop trajectories diverge around an object, 
not all drops in the frontal view of the object impinge on the object. 
The fraction of water drops that do impinge is termed the "Water Collection Efficiency". 
Once drops impinge on a surface they tend to remain on the surface. 
The water collection efficiency can vary widely, 
depending on factors such as the water drop size and object size, airspeed, 
air pressure, and others. 
The water collection efficiency can also be zero for some cases 
(such as very small water drops, a very large object, and a low airspeed). </p>
<p>Collection efficiency is the ratio of the area of impingement to the frontal area:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure II-3. Graphical representation of parameters used in trajectory work." src="/images%2FModern%20Icing%20Technology%2FFigure%20II-3.png"> <br>
<em>from <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/7990/bad2682.0001.001.pdf?sequence=5">"Modern Icing Technology" (1952)</a></em>  </p>
<p>The water drops do not impinge everywhere on a surface, they tend to 
only hit near the leading edge. The limits of where they hit is termed 
"Impingement Limits". These can vary with conditions details such as airspeed and drop size.</p>
<p>In a particular cloud, not all water drops are the same size. 
The "Langmuir Drop Size Distributions" describe an idealized approximation of 
how the drop sizes vary in a cloud about an average or median drop size. 
It has seven bins, each with a representative drop size and fraction of the 
total water content in the cloud. </p>
<p>Much study has been done on the conditions that cause icing on an aircraft in flight. 
The data were collected into graphs in design documents and certification requirements. 
They give expected values for intensity or concentration of supercooled water in g/m^3 
("Liquid Water Content" or "LWC"), 
and mean or average drop size 
("Mean Effective Drop Diameter" "MED" or "Median Volumetric Diameter" "MVD"). 
Other factors also have to be specified, such as temperature and altitude, 
for a complete definition. </p>
<p>A definition of icing conditions:<br>
<img alt="AppCfig1.png" src="/images%2FAppCfig1.png"><br>
<em><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25/appendix-Appendix%20C%20to%20Part%2025">from Part 25 Appendix C (1964)</a></em>  </p>
<p>"Continuous Maximum Icing Conditions" are for stratiform or layer-type clouds, 
which can extend for several miles.  </p>
<p>"Intermittent Maximum Icing Conditions" are for cumuliform  or "storm" type clouds, 
which extend over a lesser distance, but have more intense icing conditions.  </p>
<p>Regulations cover large drop icing conditions, 
termed "Appendix O", were published in 2014. 
These have lWC values and extents roughly comparable to Continuous Maximum Icing Conditions, 
but have larger drop sizes. There are four detailed conditions definitions. 
The "Freezing Drizzle" definition includes drop sizes over 200 micrometers. 
The "Freezing Rain" definition includes drop sizes over 1000 micrometers. 
The larger drops can cause icing in locations where Appendix C 
size drops do not reach. </p>
