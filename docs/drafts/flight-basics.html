<p>Airplanes can fly because engines produce thrust that propels it forward, 
and wings produce lift to counteract weight. </p>
<p>A wing is a well-shaped airfoil that can produce lift with minimal drag. 
If ice accumulates on a wing in flight, that changes the shape of the airfoil, 
which is then likely to not be as efficient at producing lift. 
Drag can also increase. </p>
<p>The lift an airfoil can produce is affected by the "Angle of Attack" of the wing with respect to the air motion over it. 
The coefficient of lift (Cl) is a non-dimensional measure of lift, and is proportional to lift. 
Lift data for airfoils is commonly plotted as a function of angle of attack. 
Lift generally increases with angle of attack. 
However, at some angle, the maximum lift is reached, 
and higher angles produce less lift. 
This is termed stall. 
If the angle of attack is not reduced to re-establish adequate lift, 
the airplane can descend rapidly, and this is a hazardous condition. </p>
<p>To some extent, increasing angle of attack can off-set the effects of ice. 
However, the margin to stall conditions is reduced. 
In extreme cases, this is hazardous.</p>
<p>Increasing airspeed (the speed at which the airplane flies relative to the air) can increase lift. 
Stall speed is a term for an airspeed that may induce a stall, 
as the angle of attack would have to be increased to the maximum level to maintain flight. 
With ice on a wing, a higher airspeed can partially off-set the effects of ice. 
However, there are limits, as the engine can only produce so much thrust, 
and drag increases with airspeed. 
Airplane structure has airspeed limits, particularly for deployed features such as flaps.<br>
Also, landing at a very high airspeed can be impractical and hazardous. </p>
<p>Ice can also affect the controllability of the airplane. 
Control surfaces such as ailerons can be less effective with ice on the wing leading edge. 
Ice can collect on control surface balance horns and affect the balance, 
or jamb the motion of the control surface. </p>
<p>Ice protection systems can counter-act these effects and enable 
safe flight through icing conditions. </p>
