<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Several methods of cyclic de-icing of a gas-heated airfoil were
investigated to determine ice-removal characteristics and heating requirements. 
The cyclic de-icing system with a spanwise ice-free parting strip
in the stagnation region and a constant-temperature gas-supply duct gave
the quickest and most reliable ice removal. Heating requirements for the
several methods of cyclic de-icing are compared, and the savings over
continuous ice prevention are shown. Data are presented to show the
relation of surface temperature, rate of surface heating, and heating
time to the removal of ice.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The advent of high-speed, all-weather, jet-powered aircraft has
emphasized the need for ice-protection systems that are light-weight,
dependable, and automatic and that impose the least possible penalty on
over-all aircraft performance. Anti-icing systems that evaporate all the
impinging eater cause practically no increase in drag but, at high
speeds, require-large rates of surface heating (ref. 1). These large
heating requirements in an electric system call for a large generating
capacity, which involves excessive weight; in a hot-gas system large
flows of heated air are required, resulting in excessive thrust losses
when the air is taken from the jet-engine compressor.  </p>
<p>The large heating requirements associated with continuous anti-icing
can be greatly reduced by the use, of a cyclic de-icing system, wherein
only one spanwise segment of an airfoil is heated and de-iced at any
given time. Intermittent heating and shedding of ice successively from
many such segments in repeated cycles will permit a given heat flow to
de-ice many times as much area as would be continuously anti-iced by the
same flow. Consequently, a large reduction in the over-all heating
requirement for an airfoil is realized.  </p>
<p>Cyclic de-icing may be accomplished by using either electric or hot-gas 
heat sources. A typical electric cyclic de-icing system is described
in reference 2. Heating requirements and resultant penalties for an aircraft 
with this type of ice-protection system are given in reference 1.
Recently, efforts have been directed toward the development of hot-gas
cyclic de-icing systems. The principal advantages of hot-gas cyclic
de-icing are: The heat supply is readily available at the jet engines;
the surface heating channels may be constructed integrally with the airfoil 
structure to permit a low weight-increase factor; and the operation
of hot-gas systems is basically reliable, so that low maintenance costs
result. The first experimental investigation of cyclic de-icing with
hot gas is reported in reference 3, in which successful de-icing was
accomplished with considerable savings of heat over continuous anti-icing.  </p>
<p>The effect of a hot-gas cyclic de-icing system on aircraft performance 
has not been completely evaluated at present. However, the drag
increases associated with hot-gas cyclic de-icing are presented in reference 4. 
Drag data obtained for an 8-foot-chord NACA 651-212 airfoil
indicate that only moderate airfoil drag increases are to be expected
from runback icing caused by cyclic ice removal and that after ice
removal the drag returns almost to the bare airfoil drag. Only in severe
icing conditions with high rates of water interception does the drag
increase during the icing period exceed 15 percent.  </p>
<p>This investigation presents a comparison of heat requirements and
ice-removal characteristics for several methods of cyclic de-icing with
hot gas. The de-icing systems investigated differed principally with
regard to the means of obtaining elevated gas temperatures at the surfaces 
to be de-iced and in regard to the use of ice-free parting strips
in the stagnation region to facilitate ice removal. Because of the present 
lack of fundamental knowledge on cyclic de-icing processes, extensive
data on heating rates, surface temperatures, and ice-removal times for
various surface locations are presented to provide a basis for future
analytical treatments. The investigation was made in the NACA Lewis icing
research tunnel over a wide range of icing and operating conditions.</p>

<p>Over-All Performance of Cyclic De-Icing Systems  </p>
<p>Typical ice formations with marginal de-icing. </p>
<p>Ice formations
characteristic of marginal de-icing in various atmospheric and operating
conditions are shown in figure 4 by photographs of the airfoil forward
section before and after the heat-on periods. The difficulty and possible
variance in establishing consistent marginal heating conditions are
apparent from these photographs. Varying amounts of residual and runback
icing can be seen in the photographs taken after the marginal heat-on
periods. Negligible runback icing is shown in figure 4(a). In figure 4(b) 
runback deposits have begun to collect directly impinging droplets 
and are growing forward and outward. The deposits aft of the heated
forward section are caused by impingement upon frost particles. The airfoil 
invariably frosted as soon as water sprays began, probably because
of air-stream turbulence and supersaturation of the tunnel air, which is
not the usual case in flight. Primary impingement icing on the upper
surface was always completely removed, as shown typically in figure 4(c).
Runback icing on the upper surface consisted of thin streaks of ice
starting about 9 inches back from the leading edge. These runback streaks
did not grow materially, because they shed sporadically during subsequent
heat-on periods.</p>

<p>Parting-strip characteristics. - Data were obtained on the temperatare 
pattern associated with the spanwise parting strip used in system
A. From these data the heat-flow rate through the conductive fin and
the ice-free width of the parting strip may be determined. A typical
temperature pattern is shown in figure 12, in which distances are measured 
along the heat paths from the juncture of the conductive fin and
the external skin. These temperatures were taken after 4 minutes of
icing and before cyclic removal. The temperature drop between the gas in
the duct and the duct wall was small, representing approximately 20 percent 
of the total drop between gas and peak surface temperature. The
temperature drop across the slip joint was approximately 35 percent of
the gas-to-surface temperature differential. Without a slip joint, the
same heat flow to the parting strip would be maintained with a thinner
or longer conductive fin than was used herein. The fin length and thickness 
are of importance in transmitting the proper amount of heat flow
for establishing a narrow parting strip.</p>
<p>The surface-temperature pattern reveals the heating effectiveness in
the parting strip. The surface temperature should return quickly to the
datum level on both sides of the parting strip to minimize heat losses
by conduction along the surface. Such is the case on the upper-surface
side of the parting strip, but the lower-surface temperature falls much
more gradually. The arrows at approximately 1/2 inch from the center of
the parting strip (fig. 12) indicate the start of the corrugated inner-skin 
passages. The added thickness and conductivity of the double-skin
construction require a larger distance for the surface temperature to
return to datum.</p>
<p>The width of the parting strip that is above 32° F prior to the
heat-on period may be determined from the surface-temperature pattern
(fig. 12), and it was found to be conveniently expressible as a function
of the temperature ratio ( ts,max - 32 ) / ( ts,max - td ) shown in figure 13 for all 
conditions investigated. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
From the present investigation of several methods of cyclic de-icing
of a gas-heated airfoil, the following principal results were obtained:<br>
1. For equivalent icing conditions and heating rates, when all ice-free 
parting strips were removed from a cyclic de-icing system, approximately 
50 percent longer heat-on periods were required for marginal ice
protection; when parting strips were removed and the return-flow 
(continuously heated) gas-supply duct was changed to a single-passage gas
duct, an increase of approximately 85 percent in the heat-on periods was
required. Removal of all parting strips reduced the spanwise drop in
supply-gas temperature by approximately one-third.<br>
2. The equivalent-continuous or heat-source requirement for marginal
cyclic de-icing was nearly the same for heating systems with or without
parting strips. The heat-source requirement was increased from 10 to
50 percent when continuous heating of the gas-supply duct was eliminated.
3. The heat-source requirement for cyclic de-icing was between one-fourth 
and one-tenth of the comparable heating requirement for continuous
anti-icing.<br>
4. The heating time required for ice removal was an inverse function
of the heating rate; however, the surface temperature at ice removal
appeared to be a random variation between 32° and approximately 100° F.
The greatest external effect on the surface temperature during the de-icing 
period was caused by flows of water and melting ice over the surface.<br>
5. Parting strips, insulation, and continuous heating of the gas-supply 
system were advantageous for quick and reliable shedding of dangerous 
leading-edge ice caps and good heat utilization.  </p>
