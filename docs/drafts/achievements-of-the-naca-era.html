<p><img alt="NASA SP 3406 quote." src="/images%2FNASA%20SP%203406%20quote.png">
<em>From NASA SP-3406</em>  </p>
<p>For most of the reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 
I have tried to be neutral about whether one is "better" than another
(they all have merit), 
except for noting how often they were cited and used later. 
This may have de-emphasized some of the biggest achievements, 
which are often not contained in just one publication. </p>
<p>NACA did not invent several of these items. 
NACA did find good ideas from many sources, and collaborated with industry, academia, 
and other government entities. 
They fulfilled their mission statement several times.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct 
the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution ...  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have selected six "Crowning Achievements" of the NACA-era.  </p>
<p>Two have received formal recognition in other sources 
(robust ice protection, the Icing Research Tunnel).  </p>
<p>There are four others that I feel have been under-appreciated.  </p>
<p>NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
provides several observations.  </p>
<h2>Robust ice protection</h2>
<p>One indication of the contemporary importance of the NACA efforts was 
the National Aeronautic Association 1946 Collier Trophy award to Lewis Rodert of NACA 
“For his pioneering research and guidance in the development and practical application of a thermal ice prevention system for aircraft.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>Note that the NACA efforts achieved complete, robust airplane ice protection. 
Protection for the wings and engines often gets the most attention, 
but flight in icing can quickly reveal other components that are not adequately protected, 
such as windshields, airspeed instruments, antennas, etc. 
See <a href="/component-icing.html">Component Ice Protection</a>.  </p>
<p>From <a href="/naca-tn-2569.html">NACA-TN-2569</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A total of 305 traverses of cumuliform clouds by P-61C airplanes were made in icing conditions, and on no occasion did ice accumulate before the end of a traverse to such an extent as to make safe flight impossible.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cumuliform clouds are associated with a higher rate of icing call Intermittent Maximum Icing. 
Before the NACA efforts for ice protection, 305 traverses would have been fool-hardy.  </p>
<p>It is notable that this was accomplished prior to the other achievements noted here. 
The was little knowledge of the icing atmosphere, as adequate instruments were not yet available. 
The Icing Research Tunnel was used, but it was found to not yet be adequate for the task. 
Ice protection thermodynamic analysis was developing at the time, but was of limited use, 
partly because the key values of icing conditions were not well known. 
Robust ice protection soon enabled advancement in other areas, 
particularly measuring icing conditions in flight. </p>

<h2>The Icing Research Tunnel</h2>
<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognized the IRT as an 
"International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark" in 1987 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Readers may be also interested in 
<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a>, 
which has more information on the history of the Icing Research Tunnel. </p>
<p>The Icing Research Tunnel is still used today, for both research and industry tests. 
Numerous improvements through the years have enabled an 80+ year life span.  </p>

<h2>The rotating multicylinder instrument</h2>
<p>Without reliable instruments, 
one could not know what icing conditions are likely to be encountered, 
and reliable test and design could not proceed.  </p>
<p>The rotating multicylinder instrument was assessed over and over again
(that is why there is an entire <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">Icing on Cylinders Thread</a> with 17 posts). 
It was at times criticised, but there was no better instrument in the NACA-era 
(see the <a href="/conclusions-of-the-meteorological-instruments-thread.html">Conclusions of the Meteorological Instruments Thread</a>).  </p>
<p>Nobel Prize awardee Iring Langmuir (1932 for surface chemistry), together with Katherine Blodgett, 
put the analysis of the instrument on a sound theoretical footing. 
Even that was criticised, 
but more recent assessments show that the Langmuir and Blodgett analysis was accurate. </p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thermodynamic models of ice formation</h2>
<p>NACA progressed from the early, "cut-and-try testing of components" to 
"the design of heated wings on a fundamental, wet-air basis now can be undertaken with reasonable certainty."  </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rinaldo J. Brun, William Lewis, Porter Perkins, and John
Serafini produced a technical report [NACA-TR-1215] that calculated the impingement rate of cloud droplets on the
rotating multicylinder. The report shows a solid command of boundary layer theory, heat transfer,
experimental physics, and instrumentation that sets it strikingly apart from the simple empiricism
of the reports of the mid-1940s. The discipline had indeed been placed on a rational basis.</p>

<h2>The icing design requirements</h2>
<p>It is difficult to design and test an ice protection system if the icing flight environment
(liquid water content, water drop size, temperature, and other factors) 
are not well known. </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> [emphasis added]:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1946 Lewis Rodert took charge of the icing program at the Cleveland laboratory. In a
March 1947 memo, Rodert stressed the importance of gathering statistical data on icing clouds.
These data would allow the Civil Aeronautics Administration to craft regulations to certify new
aircraft if they met guidelines in providing ice-protection equipment. Reliable data were needed
because of the <strong>"general disagreement over what constitutes a safe design basis for the heated
wing."</strong>  The Cleveland and Ames laboratories collaborated on this program.  </p>
<p>By 1948 the program had logged a total of 249 icing encounters and had taken about 1000
measurements of liquid water content and droplet diameter. This was a collaborative flight
research program carried out by the Air Force in the upper Mississippi Valley, by Ames in the
West, and by Lewis Laboratory in the Great Lakes area. John H. Enders, an intrepid pilot from
Cleveland's Flight Research program, flew the dangerous missions over Lake Erie, bringing back
his Consolidated bomber encrusted with ice. In October the NACA group presented a tentative
table of design conditions to the NACA Subcommittee on Icing Problems. This report defined the
parameters for which icing protection was necessary for safe operation. The statistical data in
this NACA report became the basis for the design criteria for federal requirements for aircraft
icing protection adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in the mid-1950s. In reflecting
on the success of this effort, William Lewis wrote in 1969, "Considering the fact that we had data
from 167 encounters in layer clouds and 73 in cumulus, statistical extrapolation to a probability
of 1/1000 was more than daring, it was down right foolhardy" Nevertheless, more recent research
using a much larger data base confirmed the conclusions of the 1949 report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "NACA Report" is <a href="/naca-tn-1855.html">NACA-TN-1855</a>, 
the "much larger data base" is described in "Review of Icing Criteria" in <a href="/the-greatest-thing-that-you-have-probably-never-read-1969-aircraft-ice-protection-report-of-symposium.html">1969 Aircraft Ice Protection Report of Symposium (FAA)</a>.  </p>
<p>The values determined by NACA are still in the current FAA icing certification regulations.  </p>

<h2>Icing design manuals</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Aircraft are now capable of flying in icing clouds without difficulty, however, because research by the NACA and others has provided the engineering basis for icing protection systems"<br>
<em>from <a href="/drafts/the-icing-problem.html">The Icing Problem</a></em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NACA tests, valuable though they were, 
would not be so useful if analysis could not fit the data.  </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref4:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To verify whether tests in the tunnel accurately reproduced actual
flight conditions, the heat transfer data obtained by J. K. Hardy at Ames in his famous study of
the heated wing were compared to tests on the same wing mounted in the icing tunnel. The data
were in agreement.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "famous study" was <a href="/naca-tr-831.html">NACA-TR-831</a>,
the tunnel comparison was <a href="/thermal-analysis-and-surface-wettedness.html">NACA-TN-2480</a>.  </p>
<p>Design manuals encapsulate the knowledge in reusable forms.  </p>
<p>Fully half of the citations in <a href="/ads-4.html">FAA-ADS-4 “Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data”, 1963</a> 
are NACA publications. </p>
