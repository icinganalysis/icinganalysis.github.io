<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>An investigation to determine the effectiveness of icing protection 
afforded by air-heating hollow steel unpartitioned propeller
blades has been conducted In the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel.
The propeller used was a production model modified with blade shank
and tip openings to permit internal passage of heated air. Blade-surface 
and heated-air temperatures were obtained and photographic
observations of ice formations were made with variations in icing
intensity and heating rate to the blades.</p>
<p>The complete research program involved investigation of air-heating 
(1) fully hollow unpartitioned propeller blades, 
(2) propeller blades partitioned to confine the air flow to the forward
one-half of the blade cavity, and 
(3) propeller blades partitioned to confine the air flow to the forward one-fourth of the blade
Cavity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 3. Details of air-heated propeller installation." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1586%2FFigure%203.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the conditions of Icing to which the propeller was subjected,
it was found that adequate ice protection was afforded with a heating
rate of 40,000 Btu per hour per blade. With less than 40,000 Btu per
hour per blade, ice protection failed because of significant ice
accretions on the leading edge. The chordwise distribution of heat
was unsatisfactory with most of the available heat dissipated well
back of the leading edge on both the thrust and camber face's
instead of at the leading edge where it was most needed. A low
utilization of available heat for icing protection is indicated
by a heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 47 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 6. Chordwise thermocoouple locations." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1586%2FFigure%206.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With 50-percent partitioning of the blades, adequate icing protection 
at 1050 rpm was obtained with a heating rate of 26,000 Btu
per hour per blade at the blade shank using an air temperature of
4000 F with a flow rate of 280 pounds per hour per blade, which is
one-third less heat than was found necessary for similar ice protection 
with unpartitioned blades. The chordwise distribution of
the applied heat, as determined by surface temperature measurements,
was considered unsatisfactory with much of the heat dissipated well
back of the leading edge. Heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 
56 percent also indicated poor utilization of available heat.
This effectiveness was, however, 9 percent greater than that obtained
from unpartitioned blades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surface temperature measurements indicated that confining the
heated air forward of the 25-percent chord gave a more economical
distribution of the applied heat as compared with unpartitioned and
50-percent partitioned blades, by dissipating a greater percentage
of the available heat at the leading edge. At a propeller speed
of 850 rpm, a heating rate of 7000 Btu per hour per blade at a
shank air temperature of 400 F provided adequate icing protection
at ambient-air temperatures of 230 F but not at temperatures as
low as 150 F. With the heating rate used, a heat-exchanger
effectiveness of 77 percent was obtained as compared to 56 percent
for 50-percent partitioned and 47 percent for unpartitioned blades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS  </p>
<p>The high heat-exchanger effectiveness associated with the
25-percent partitioned blades and the lower heat-input rate required
as compared to the unpartitioned and 50-percent partitioned blades
indicate that partitioning the cavity at approximately 25-percent.
chord provides the most economical method of those examined for air-heating 
propeller blades. If heat were supplied to the blade at a
sufficient rate to maintain satisfactory leading-edge temperatures
and surface temperatures near the rear of the blade were not raised
adequately to prevent runback icing under all conditions, part of
the heated air could be bled to the rear chamber through orifices
in the partition without destroying the concentration of heat at
the leading edge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A lightweight instrument that utilizes resistance-wire electric
strain gages to measure propeller-shaft thrust has been developed.
A wind-tunnel investigation on a propeller installed, on a single-engine 
pursuit airplane showed that the instrument gave a reliable
indication of propeller-shaft thrust to an accuracy of ±2 percent
within its calibrated range. No attempt was made to determine the
relation of indicated shaft thrust to net propeller thrust.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>Measurement of propeller thrust during icing conditions is
essential to determine the aerodynamic effects of Ice formations
on propellers or to evaluate the effectiveness of ice-protection
methods. An investigation in the 16-foot tunnel at the NACA
Langley laboratory showed no serious effects on propeller performance 
of an artificial simulation of ice on the blades (reference 1).
An exact measure of the effect of the propeller alone can be
obtained from propeller thrust measurements with and without ice
protection during icing conditions. Other conditions being equal,
the net change in thrust caused by ice formations is indicated by
a change in propeller-shaft thrust.  </p>
<p>An investigation of propeller-icing effects and various systems
of thermal ice protection has been made under simulated icing conditions 
in the icing research tunnel at the NACA Lewis laboratory.
The need for an accurate device to measure propeller thrust and
especially to measure incremental changes in thrust due to ice formations, 
when other conditions remain constant, led to the construction of a 
thrust meter of an electric strain-gage type to be
installed on the propeller shaft; the thrust meter utilizes an
electric circuit similar to that of the NACA electric torquemeter
described in reference 2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS  </p>
<p>Results of a tunnel investigation of the electric propeller-shaft 
thrust meter installed on a single-engine pursuit airplane
show that the meter reliably indicates propeller-shaft thrust
with an accuracy of ±2 percent within its calibrated range. Measurement 
of propeller-shaft thrust with this type of instrument is
useful in determining for a given installation the relative effects
on thrust of various blade-surface-roughness conditions resulting
from ice formations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I believe that test experience in the icing tunnel was valuable later in his career, 
and the thrust meter experience was valuable for later icing instrument designs. 
Such experiences were valuable in my career. </p>
