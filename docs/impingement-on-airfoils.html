<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Several airfoils were analyzed and tested for water-drop impingement in the NACA-era. </p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate and area of cloud droplet impingement on several two-dimensional 
swept and unswept airfoils were obtained experimentally in
the NACA Lewis icing tunnel with a dye-tracer technique. Airfoil thickness 
ratios of 6 to 16 percent; angles of attack from 0° to 12°, and
chord sizes from 13 to 96 inches were included in the study. The data
were obtained at 152 knots and are extended to other conditions by dimensionless 
impingement parameters.<br>
In general, the data show that the total and local collection efficiencies and 
impingement limits are primary functions of the modified 
inertia parameter (in which airspeed, droplet size, and body size are
the most significant variables)and the airfoil thickness ratio. Local
collection efficiencies and impingement limits also depend on angle of
attack. Secondary factors affecting impingement characteristics are airfoil 
shape, camber, and sweep angle. The impingement characteristics obtained 
experimentally for the airfoils were within +/-10 percent on the
average of the characteristics calculated from theoretical trajectories.
Over the range of conditions studied, the experimental data demonstrate
that a specific method can be used to predict the impingement characteristics 
of swept airfoils with large aspect ratios from the data for unswept airfoils 
of the same series.</p>

It is long (80 pages), with most of the pages being detailed figures. </p>
<p>I will briefly mention NACA-TN-4025 here, although it may merit a full review to itself. 
The rather thick 36.5% Joukowski airfoil is offered as an alternative to the cylinder as a 
dye-tracer instrument. Benefits include potentially better discrimination of drop sizes when used 
to determine drop-size spectra. The effects of boundary layers and aft flow separation are also discussed. 
Both of those effects appear to be small, as impingement calculated with potential flow, 
which does not include either of those effects, compares well to experimentally measured data. </p>

<p>SUMMARY
The general effect of wing sweep on cloud-droplet trajectories
about swept wings of high aspect ratio moving at subsonic speeds is
discussed. A method of computing droplet trajectories about yawed
cylinders and swept wings is presented, and illustrative droplet trajectories 
are computed.<br>
A method of extending two-dimensional calculations of droplet
impingement on nonswept wings to swept wings is presented. It is shown
that the extent of impingement of cloud droplets on an airfoil surface,
the total rate of collection of water, and the local rate of impingement 
per unit area of airfoil surface can be found for a swept wing
from two-dimensional data for a nonswept wing. The impingement on a
swept wing is obtained from impingement data for a nonswept airfoil
section which is the same as the section in the normal plane of the
swept wing by calculating all dimensionless parameters with respect to
flow conditions in the normal plane of the swept wing.</p>
<p>Because of its geometric and aerodynamic simplicity, the problem
of impingement on a yawed circular cylinder will be considered first.
The method developed for the cylinder will apply equally well to a
swept wing, and this application will be discussed in detail in a subsequent 
section.<br>
The incompressible nonviscous velocity field around a yawed circular
cylinder of infinite span can be divided into components in the x-, y-,
and z-directions, as shown in figure 1. The right-rectangular coordinate
system is established so that the center line of the cylinder coincides
with the z-axis. The angle of yaw y is measured with respect to the
negative x-axis. The flow in the xy-plane (normal plane) is the same
as the flow about a nonyawed circular cylinder which has a free-stream
velocity equal to the component of the free-stream velocity in the normal
plane U cos γ. The velocity component in the z-direction is a constant
throughout the flow field, and the magnitude of the component is determined 
by the projection of the free-stream velocity on the z-axis
U sin γ.<br>
The effect of yaw on the streamlines and local air velocity vectors
can be illustrated by an example in which the flow field about a yawed
circular cylinder is presented. For this example, the yawed. cylinder is
assumed oriented in an x,y,z-coordinate system as shown in figure 1.
The angle of yaw γ with respect to the free-stream direction is 30°.
The projection of two streamlines, selected for illustration, upon the
xy- and xz-planes is shown in figure 2. (The method of calculation is
given in appendix A.) Also shown are the projections of velocity vectors 
upon the xz-plane at various points in the sheet (surface perpendicular 
to the xy-plane containing the streamline) which contains each
streamline. Considerable deviation of the streamlines from the projection 
of the free-stream direction in the xz-plane is indicated in the
figure. The curvature of the streamlines in the xz-plane is due to the
fact that, whereas the Ux component changes in magnitude with x and.
y, Uz is a constant independent of x or y. The z velocity component 
u is a constant throughout the flow field, because in a
frictionless fluid it is equal only to the projection along the z-axis
of the free-stream velocity U and is not influenced by the perturbation 
velocity of the cylinder in the xy-plane. The maximum curvature
of the streamline projections in the xz-plane takes place in those
streamlines located near a surface defined by the stagnation stream-lines. 
This maximum curvature of the stagnation streamlines is to be
expected, because along a stagnation line where u becomes small
(close to the body), uz is relatively predominant and the displacement
is primarily in the z-direction.</p>

<p>Sample Droplet Trajectories About Yawed Cylinder<br>
Three-dimensional droplet trajectories were calculated for a yawed
cylinder for conditions where the inertia parameter Kn is equal to
2.78 and the free-stream Reynolds number in the normal plane Re0,n
equal to 100. The projections upon the xy- and xz-planes of typical
droplet trajectories are shown in figure 3. The starting ordinate
(at x = -∞) in the xy-plane for each trajectory is given by the value
of y_o in the figure.</p>
<p>Swept Wings
The calculation of droplet trajectories about a swept wing can be
accomplished by the method used for the yawed cylinder in the preceding
sections, if the flow field about a swept wing is approximated (except
near the fuselage and wing tips) by the incompressible nonviscous flow
about an Infinite-span wing of zero taper at an angle of yaw equal
to the sweep angle. This approximation is valid for wings of high
aspect ratio and small taper.<br>
The nonviscous flow field about a yawed wing of infinite span can
be obtained in the same manner as that for the yawed cylinder by determining 
the components in the normal (xy) plane (fig. 4) and the component parallel to 
the leading edge (z-direction). The flow field in
the normal plane is determined from two-dimensional theory by using the
airfoil section in the normal plane and the component of the free-stream 
velocity in the normal plane U_s cos γ. As before, the
z-component is constant throughout the flow field, being simply the
projection of the free-stream velocity upon the z-axis U_s sin γ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the swept wing is at a free-stream angle of attack α_s
(fig. 4), the effective angle of attack in the normal plane, to a close
approximation, is α_n = α_s sec γ and the components of the free-stream
velocity are U sin ra. and U_s cos γ where γ_α is the angle between
U and U_n. For small angles of attack, γ_α is for all practical purposes 
equal to γ and therefore γ can be used when calculating the
components of the free-stream velocity; however, the corrected angle of
attack α_s sec γ must be used in obtaining the flow field in the normal
plane.
Air streamlines about a 651-212 airfoil-at 45° yaw and an angle of
attack in the normal plane of 4° (α_s = 2.8°) are shown in figure 5.
The projection of three streamlines on the xy-plane from x = -1 to 0.1
is shown in figure 5(a), and the projection on the xz-plane is shown in
figure 5(b). The method used. to obtain the streamlines is given in
appendix B. As for the cylinder, the projections of the streamlines in
the xz-plane deviate from the projection of the free-stream direction
because of changes in U_x. The deviation from the projection of the
free-stream direction is considerably less for the airfoil than for a
cylinder with the same chord length, as would be expected from comparison 
of the velocity field of a thin body with that of a blunt body.  </p>
<p>Sample Droplet Trajectories About Yawed Wing<br>
The projections upon the xy- and xz-planes of typical droplet
trajectories about a 651-212 airfoil with α_s = 2.8° (α = 4°) and at
a yaw angle of 45 are shown in figure 5 for values of K = 0.1
and Re0,n = 128. As in the case of the air streamlines, there is less
curvature of the xz-projection of the trajectory for the airfoil than
for the relatively blunt cylinder. For example, up to about 1 chord
length (x = -1, fig. 5(b)) ahead of the wing the droplets are essentially 
undeviated from the free-stream plane; whereas, for the cylinder
they are undeviated only up to about 2 diameters (x = -5, fig. 3) ahead
of the cylinder.</p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS
An analysis of the general effect of sweep on the droplet trajectories 
about a swept airfoil and a method of calculating the droplet
trajectories have been presented. The extent of impingement of cloud
droplets on the airfoil surface, the rate of collection of total water
in droplet form, and the local rate of impingement per unit area of the
airfoil surface can be found for a swept wing from two-dimensional data
for a nonswept wing with the same airfoil section as the section in the
normal plane of the swept wing. The values of the dimensionless parameters 
required in order to interpret the two-dimensional data are calculated 
with respect to the normal plane of the swept wing rather than
with respect to the free-stream plane as is the usual procedure for
nonswept wings.</p>

<h4>Spray water-drop size distribution</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Spray Cloud Properties<br>
The cloud total liquid-water content was obtained by collecting dye
from the spray cloud in an aspirating device (a tube that draws in air
and liquid water at free-stream conditions, ref. 15). The inlet velocity
of the device was always within 1 percent of the free-stream  value, denoting 
theoretically a 100-percent collection efficiency.<br>
The droplet-size distribution was determined by the method outlined
in reference 15, in which the experimental impingement rates for cylinders
are related to theoretical data for similar cylinders. In the present
study, however, small 36.5-percent-thick Joukowski airfoils were used
instead of cylinders. The absolute values of droplet size from this airfoil 
section (see appendix B) generally confirm those obtained from the
cylinders of reference 15, but the body size trend is reduced from that
of reference 15.<br>
The ratio of droplet diameter to volume-median diameter &lt;1&gt; is presented
in figure as a function of the ratio of cumulative liquid-water content
to total liquid-water content. The volume-median droplet diameters are
believed accurate within +/- 6 percent. These data are from the aspirator
and 36.5-percent Joukowski airfoil analyses for the three spray conditions
(air-water pressure ratios) studied.  </p>
<p>&lt;1&gt; Volume-median droplet diameter is that diameter for which half the
total liquid-water content is contained in droplets larger than the volume 
median and half in droplets smaller than the volume median.</p>

<h4>"correlates the data as much as possible"</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Variation of E_m with K0,med.<br>
The total collection efficiency 
of an airfoil Em increases as K0,med increases (fig. 12). These data
are plotted from table I for an angle of attack of 0°. In the range of
K0,med &lt; 0.02 the increase in Em with a decrease in the thickness ratio
is readily apparent in figure 12 for airfoils of the same series and
camber. For example, at 0° angle of attack and K0,med of 0.01 the Em
values for the NACA 651-206, 651-212, and 652-216 airfoil sare 0.105,
0.06, and 0.05, respectively. These airfoils, although their numbering
systems are somewhat different, are of the same series, differing primarily 
in thickness ratio and only to a minor degree in leading-edge radius
and location of maximum-thickness point. These latter differences are
considered of secondary significance in the evaluation of total collection
efficiency. Reversals of this change in Em with thickness ratio may
occur at high K0,med values (K0,med &gt; 0.02), especially as the thickness
ratio approaches 6 or 4 percent.</p>

<h4>The effect of sweep</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Correlation of Effect of Airfoil Sweepback<br>
The experimental impingement data substantiate the method of reference 14 
for predicting the impingement on a swept airfoil from data obtained on an 
unswept airfoil where (1) the wing can be considered two-dimensional or 
has a high aspect ratio and (2) the airfoil section in a
plane perpendicular to the leading edge of the swept airfoil is the same
section as that of the unswept airfoil. The application of the method
of reference 14 to the experimental impingement data presented herein is
discussed in appendix C. Typical experimental values of local collection
efficiency β as a function of s for the 35° swept (NACA 651-212 and 651-206) 
airfoils are presented for angles of attack (referenced to freestream 
velocity direction) of 0° and 4.3° in figures 18(a) and (b), respectively. 
The faired lines of figure 18 represent the β values calculated from the unswept 
experimental data by the method of reference 14. 
Good agreement between calculated swept and experimental swept values of β 
was obtained for the angles of attack and the airfoils studied. Similar good agreement 
was obtained for values of S_max and E_m.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>From NACA-TN-3839:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The impingement characteristics  of several airfoils obtained experimentally 
using a dye-tracer technique yield the following results:<br>
1. In general, the data show that the local and total water catch
and the limit of impingement of airfoils are primary functions of the
modified inertia parameter (in which airspeed and droplet and body size
are the most significant variables) and airfoil thickness ratio. In
addition, the local water collection rate and the extent of impingement
on the airfoil surfaces depend on the airfoil angle of attack. Secondary
factors affecting airfoil impingement characteristics are airfoil shape
(for a given thickness ratio), small camber, and sweep angle.<br>
2. With an increase in the modified inertia parameter, the total and
local collection efficiencies and the impingement limits also increase.
For those airfoils of a comparable series operating at a typical flight
value of the modified inertia parameter, a thickness ratio of 6 percent
had total collection efficiencies of 1.7 and 2 times those of a 12- and
15-percent-thick airfoil, respectively. Airfoils with relatively blunt
leading edges (Joukowski 0015) had higher total collection efficiencies
than those with sharp leading edges (low-drag airfoils such as the NACA
652-015), although the impingement limits for the sharper airfoils were
greater than those for the blunt airfoils.<br>
3. The experimentally determined local and total collection efficiencies 
and impingement limits for the Joukowski 0015 and NACA 652-015
airfoils are in good agreement with the theoretical values. No such
agreement is obtained for the NACA 651-212 airfoil.<br>
4. Over the range of conditions studied, the experimental data substantiate 
a previous method of predicting the impingement characteristics
of swept airfoils (design section laid out perpendicular to the leading
edge) from data for the unswept design section.<br>
5. Because of the typical droplet-size distribution of the tunnel
spray, and the correlation of data by means of the modified inertia parameter, 
the experimental results herein may be applied over a wide range
of flight conditions.  </p>
