<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Meteorological icing data obtained in flight in the United States
are analyzed statistically and methods are developed for the determination of:  </p>
<p>(1) the various simultaneous combinations of the three basic
icing parameters (liquid-water content, drop diameter, and temperature)
which would have equal probability of being exceeded in flight in any
random icing encounter; and  </p>
<p>(2) the probability of exceeding any specified group of 
values of liquid-water content associated simultaneously
with temperature and drop-diameter values lying within specified ranges.  </p>
<p>The methods are particularly useful in the design of anti-icing equipment 
intended to operate through the United States, to define simultaneous 
combinations of the meteorological variables which could be
encountered, and to ascertain the effectiveness of the equipment in
withstanding the natural icing conditions to which it may be subjected.
In addition, a mathematical basis is provided for the future statistical
analysis of meteorological icing data that might be obtained throughout
the world.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This report is extensive (94 pages), so many details are not covered herein.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The program of research in aircraft ice prevention which has been
conducted by the NACA during the past several years has been directed
primarily toward the development of practical methods for the design of
thermal ice-prevention equipment for various airplane components. Since
a rational ice-prevention design requires a knowledge of the physical
characteristics of icing conditions, an important phase of the research
program has been an investigation of the meteorological conditions conducive to icing.  </p>
<p><strong>The severity of an encounter with icing, conditions is determined
principally by four factors; namely, the liquid-water content, the
diameter of the drops, the temperature, and the horizontal extent of the
conditions.</strong> The meteorological investigation has, therefore, been concerned 
with obtaining measurements of these quantities in a wide variety
of natural icing conditions in order to establish the range and relative 
frequency of occurrence of various values, and combinations of
values, of these quantities.    </p>
<p>During the period 1945 through 1948, a considerable amount of data
was collected by the Ames and Lewis Laboratories. These results, and
discussions of various phases of the investigation, have been reported
in references 1 through 4. All of these results, together with similar
data from observations made by other organizations, were used as a basis
for a listing of estimated maximum icing conditions recommended for consideration 
in the design of anti-icing equipment (reference 5). <strong>The
probable maximum values listed in reference 5 were estimated on the
basis of what was considered a reasonable extrapolation from a limited
amount of data, and the concept of the probability of encountering
various simultaneous combinations of values entered only in a subjective
and qualitative way</strong>.  </p>

<p>In this report, the available data obtained in icing flights in the
United States are analyzed statistically and the results are presented
graphically in two forms.  </p>
<p>In the first form, the results are plotted to
show the various combinations of liquid-water content, drop diameter,
and ambient-air temperature which have equal probability of being
exceeded.  </p>
<p>In the second form, plots are presented to determine the
probability of exceeding any specified value of liquid-water content
under the condition that the value is associated simultaneously with
values of temperature and drop diameter lying within specified intervals.<br>

methods for estimating values applicable to other horizontal extents are
also presented.</p>

<p>The mathematical functions used to represent the various distributions 
were chosen mainly on the basis of the empirical criterion of
goodness of fit, although theoretical considerations also were given
considerable weight, particularly in the selection of a function to
represent the distribution of maximum values in those cases in which
each item in the distribution is the maximum of a group of observed
values. The function chosen for representing such distributions is one
originated by Dr. E. J. Gumbel (reference 11) to describe a distribution
of extreme values. This function will be referred to hereinafter as
"Gumbel's distribution."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of Results of the Equiprobability Analysis With Results of NACA TN 1855  </p>
<p>Certain values of liquid-water content, drop diameter, and temperature 
were presented in NACA TN 1855 (reference 5) for consideration in
the design of anti-icing equipment. The combinations of meteorological
variables recommended, however, were lacking in one respect, namely, the
probability of occurrence of these particular combinations. Fortunately,
with the aid of the equiprobability curves, some indication of these
probabilities can be obtained when corresponding meteorological conditions are compared.  </p>
<p>Four classes of icing conditions are presented in NACA TN 1855:
I, instantaneous; II intermittent; III, continuous; and IV, freezing
rain. All classes, except IV, are subdivided into two types of icing
conditions, maximum and normal, and are confined to icing conditions
associated with definite cloud formations of characteristic horizontal
extents. Hence, classes I, II, and III are ideal for comparison with
the results which can be obtained from the equiprobability charts
(figs. 3 to 7) and the relations for horizontal extent (fig. 8).  </p>

<p>Note that the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" is 1 at 10 miles for layer clouds.</p>
<p>How the values in Figure 8 were determined is not described. 
The other factors key (LWC, drops size, temperature) have figures 
11 through 26 that describe them in detail, but the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" 
is not detailed. </p>
<p>Appendix C has a similar figure 3. However, the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" 
is equal to 1 at 17.4 nmi (20 miles). Note that NACA-TN-2738 is cited on figure 3.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Two groups of icing conditions are chosen as a basis for comparison 
between the analysis of this report and NACA TN 185. The first group
consists of icing conditions selected from the probability analysis for
the case of layer-type clouds, with an exceed.ance probability
Of Pe = 0.001. The second group consists of icing conditions for the
case of Pacific coast cumulus, also with an exceedance probability
of 0.001. These two groups are compared, respectively, with classes Ill-N
and II-M from NACA TN 1855. The comparisons are made by determining
values of liquid-water content from figure 4 and figures 3, 5, and 7 for
the various combinations of temperature and drop diameter given in
table I of NACA TN 1855 for class II-M and III-M conditions, respectively.
The three values of liquid-water content obtained from figures 3, 5,
and 7 corresponding to class III-M were averaged by weighting the values
according to the horizontal extent of the region to which they apply.  </p>
<p>The three regions (fig. 1) have area ratios of about 1/8, 2/8, and 5/8
for the Pacific coast, plateau, and eastern regions, respectively; and
these area ratios were used to weight the values of liquid-water content
from the equiprobability charts so that the resulting average values
would be on a comparable basis with the values expressed In NACA TN 1855.
The weighted average values of liquid-water content were corrected by
figure 8 to make them applicable to a horizontal extent of 20 miles, a
figure reasonably applicable to the layer-cloud data of NACA TN 1855.
For class II-M conditions, no correction for horizontal extent was
required because the values in NACA TN 1855 and figure 4 both apply to
3 miles horizontal-cloud extent.  </p>
<p>The results of the comparisons between NACA TN 1855 and the probability 
analysis are shown in tables III and IV for classes II-M and III-M,
respectively. In general, the liquid-water-content values agree quite
closely, except at temperatures of -4 F and below. In this low temperature 
range, the values of liquid-water content derived from the equiprobability 
surfaces are considerably lower than values given in NACA TN 1855.
The reason is that the probability analysis entails some extrapolation in
this temperature range, and so may not provide exactly the correct value
of liquid-water content. On the other hand, the values listed in
NACA TN 1855 are not restricted to actual measurements, and therefore may
not be of precise magnitude. For design purposes, however, the values
given by the probability analysis should be of proper magnitude. In this
regard, it should be noted that the majority of the data utilized in the
probability analysis was taken at comparatively low altitude (13,000 feet),
whereas the temperature range between -4 F and -40 F represents considerably 
higher altitudes (18,000 to 28,000 feet). This difference In altitude
could have some bearing on the accuracy of the probability data, particularly 
at very high altitudes.</p>

<p><img alt="Table IV. COMPARISON OF WEIGHTED-AVERAGE VALUES OF 
LIQUID WATER CONTENT FOR LAYER CLOUDS, Pe = 0.001, 
WITH CORRESPONDING VALUES FOR CONTINUOUS MAXIMUM 
CONDITIONS LISTED IN NACA TN 1855" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2738%2FTable%20IV.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By a procedure similar to that used in the comparisons for the two
example cases, the correspondence between classes of Icing conditions
represented by the equiprobability charts and other classes of conditions
presented in NACA TN 185 could be ascertained approximately. The correspondence 
for these classes of conditions, and also for the two example
cases, are shown in table V.  </p>
<p>An inspection of table V reveals a consistency between the classes
of design values recommended in NACA TN 1855 and specific values of
exceedance probabilities. Only the instantaneous maximum icing condition 
(Pe = 0.0001) appears to be incongruous with the maximum conditions
in classes II-M and III-M (Pe = 0.001). This apparent incongruity is
directly attributable to the fact that the instantaneous maximum condition 
presented in NACA TN 1855 was calculated for tall tropical cumulus
clouds. Such extremely severe icing conditions would, of course, be
exceeded infrequently as is borne out by the probability analysis.
Another point of interest in regard to table V Is the general order of
magnitude of the exceedance probabilities which are found to apply to
the various classes of icing conditions specified in NACA TN 1855. For
example, any one of the icing conditions listed under class II-M (intermittent 
maximum) or class III-M (continuous maximum) will be exceeded once
in only about a thousand encounters with icing conditions. It is believed
that the icing conditions specified by classes II-M and III-M do not
impose too severe design requirements and, therefore, if the ice-prevention 
system will cope with these conditions, the results of the
probability analysis indicate that satisfactory ice protection would be
provided for the vast majority of icing encounters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Partial Probability Charts  </p>
<p>The partial probability charts essentially provide a rapid means of
determining the approximate probability of exceeding any specified group
of values of liquid-water content associated simultaneously with temperature 
and drop-diameter values lying within specified ranges. Thus, if
an anti-icing component (e.g., unit span of a jet-inlet guide vane) is
designed by the method of reference 16 to withstand a constant values
of weight rate of water-drop impingement Mt, as computed from a particular 
set of values of liquid-water content, temperature, and drop diameter, 
and if other combinations of these same variables are found which
correspond to the same weight rate of drop impingement, then the probability 
of encountering conditions under which the component will not
perform satisfactorily can be determined approximately. The calculation
of this probability can be performed with the aid of the partial probability 
charts (fig. 10).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS  </p>
<p>The equiprobability surfaces and marginal probability calculation
charts presented herein provide, for the United States, a representation
of the data now available on the meteorological factors responsible for
aircraft icing, expressed In terms of the probability of exceeding
various combinations of values of these factors. The usefulness of the
results is limited somewhat by the amount of data available; errors of
measurement, especially at large values of drop diameter; 
nonrepresentativeness of the flight procedures during research flights; and limited
altitude and geographical extent of the research flight program.
In spite of these limitations, <strong>the probability analysis presented
does provide an indication, heretofore unavailable, of the combinations
of icing conditions having equal probability</strong> of being exceeded in the
United States, and also the probability of exceeding a special set of
icing conditions. Also, a procedure has been established for the statistical 
analysis of future icing meteorological data obtained on a
world-wide basis.  </p>

<p>The methods are quite tedious to use. 
They are also quite tedious to implement in a program. 
I doubt that the methods have been used much. 
I perused the 38 citations of NACA-TN-2738 and 
I did not find one that used the calculation method, 
they do cite the results and conclusions.  </p>
<p>The enduring part of NACA-TN-2738 is the confirmation that the 
sometimes "qualitative" or estimated parts of the 
icing values in NACA-TN-1855 represent something close to a more rigorously 
determined equiprobability surface with Pe=0.001. </p>
<p>Jeck <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> comments about NACA-TN-2738 ([5] in Jeck):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the original data collection flights were only in winter and spring icing conditions over
parts of the United States, the existing curves appear to represent all-season stratiform and
convective icing conditions (excluding freezing rain and freezing drizzle) for the United States
and Europe. They enclose about 99% of all measurements obtained by the research flights of the
1940s [12]. A mathematical evaluation in 1952 [5] showed that this “was roughly equivalent to
a probability of 1/1000 that all three variables (LWC, MVD, and OAT) represented by a single
point (in figure 1) would be exceeded simultaneously.” The LWC curves themselves, however,
are thought to represent the 99th percentile value of LWC for a given MVD and OAT. No other
evaluations of the envelopes have since been published.  </p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Liquid-water content, droplet size, and temperature data measured 
during 22 flights in predominantly stratiform clouds through the
1948-49 and the 1949-50 winters are presented. Several icing encounters 
were of greater severity than those previously measured over the
same geographical area, but were within the limits of similar measurements 
obtained over different terrain within the United States.
An analysis of meteorological conditions existing during the
74 flights conducted for four winters indicated an inverse relation …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The thermal analysis of icing conditions has unique challenges, 
including the determination of heat transfer coefficients and fraction of the surface wetted.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Measured heat transfer coefficients in dry air can be different between flight and tunnel tests, due to free stream turbulence. </li>
<li>Icing conditions tend to promote more turbulent flow on the surface.  </li>
<li>Assumptions about the fraction of the surface wetted aft of impingement affect the thermal analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Combustion heated air, independent of the engines, was used on some aircraft.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA.  </li>
<li>38 NACA publications detail technical aspects of aircraft heaters, 
including many details on heat exchangers, maturing engineering designs.  </li>
<li>Three publications deal with heat transfer for ice protection.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There were numerous NACA publications on aircraft heaters. 
For the combustion heaters, air was scooped in, 
heated by burning aviation gasoline, 
and used for cabin heating, and wing ice protection on some airplanes
(The DC-6, for example). </p>
<p>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA 
prior to these NACA publications. 
However, the NACA publications very much detailed 
the design of not just the heaters, 
but also associated heat exchangers and components, 
as well as data needed for analysis

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>A chordwise-sequenced zone heating ice shedding strategy was devised.  </li>
<li>The current 787 jet aircraft uses electrothermal heating for wing anti-icing and de-icing.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
Also, there are scale differences, as a wing airfoil 
usually has a larger chord length than a propeller. 
However …</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating becomes common for ice protection in the jet era.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>To support jet engine powered transportation, NACA had several studies of ice protection using compressed air heating.  </li>
<li>Deicing schemes were proposed to reduce the amount of air bled from the engines.  </li>
<li>Some innovative features, like continuously heated parting strips and 
recirculating hot air supply, did not see much use.  </li>
<li>Compressed air heating is used widely today for jet powered transports.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As aviation entered the jet propulsion age, 
reciprocating-engine exhaust heat was not an option. 
However, the jet engine air compressor offers an ample 
(but not unlimited) supply of hot, compressed air that may be bled 
from the engine compressor airstream 
for ice protection, cabin heating, and other functions. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>During the war, more than a hundred cargo planes of the Air Transport Command, 
flying from bases in India over the Hump to battlefronts in China, crashed
in the Himalayas. Most of them were brought down by ice. In a single day in 1944,
nine of these big Army transports, loaded with sorely needed supplies for the Allies’
fighting forces, were lost.<br>
Many of the fatal crashes of commercial aviation have been traced to this same
cause. For years commercial transports have been equipped with anti-icing devices,
but the apparatus in common use was designed to assist in meeting an emergency
when it arises, not to prepare the plane for deliberate flight into ice clouds. 
If dangerous icing conditions are inadvertently encountered, transport pilots are instructed
to turn back or land at a safe alternate airport …</p></blockquote>

<p>Prompt: "Write a blog post about the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection during the era of the National Advisory Committee for Aerodynamics, including citations"  </p>
<p>Response:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The National Advisory Committee for Aerodynamics (NACA) was a organization in the United States that existed from 1915 to 1958. During its existence, NACA carried out research on various aspects of aerodynamics, including the use of engine exhaust heat for aircraft ice protection.  </p>
<p>One of the early NACA reports on this topic, "Investigation of the Feasibility of Utilizing Engine Exhaust Heat for Ice Protection," was published in 1945. The report described experiments in which heat from …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><em>("Summary" in the orignal).</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject of aircraft ice protection has provoked much controversy
and discourse among theorists, designers, laboratory and test
engineers, and flight operations people. In view of this diversity
of opinion and variety of approach, some difficulty has been
experienced in applying current standards and in maintaining
uniformity in the substantiation of aircraft ice protection.
This symposium recognized the need to exchange ideas and it
provided a general review of icing criteria, ice protection
standards, methods of compliance, and service experience. It
also served as a general refresher for Federal Aviation Administration
personnel involved in the evaluation of aircraft ice protection.
Technical papers were presented by government research and test
organizations, aircraft engine and aircraft manufacturers, military
services. and airline operators. The …</p></blockquote>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>This website was written with people in mind (engineers, aerodynamicists) who already know something about aircraft and aircraft icing.  </p>
<p>To make it a little more understandable to others, I summarize here the assumed 
common knowledge, with a few of the key technical terms. </p>
<p>Airplanes require lift from the wings in order to fly. 
This lift is produced due to details of the air flowing over the well-shaped wing. </p>
<p>Ice may form on airplanes in flight in certain weather conditions. 
The ice changes the shape of the wing, and can reduce lift and produce more drag on the airplane. 
Measurements of lift are often expressed as the coefficient of lift (Cl) 
and drag as the coefficient of drag (Cd). </p>
<p>To limit the effects of ice in flight, some aircraft (and nearly every commercial airliner) 
has ice protection on parts of the wing and other aircraft surfaces. 
This protection is often heating …</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Supersaturated humidity can affect icing wind tunnel results.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Some observations of supersaturated humidity conditions were made in the NACA-era.  </li>
<li>Supersaturation was associated with frost on test article afterbodies.  </li>
<li>Recirculating icing wind tunnel conditions are calculated to tend to be supersaturated.  </li>
<li>Some potential effects of supersaturation are calculated.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>A brief primer on humidity</h2>
<p>A measurement of water vapor in the air is humidity. 
Relative humidity is the most common measure. 
In everyday life 30% to 60% relative humidity is generally considered to be comfortable. 
Lower humidities feel dry, and higher humidities feel wet or "humid".</p>
<p>The most water vapor that can usually exist at a given static temperature is termed
"saturated", and that condition has 100% relative humidity. 
Given sufficient time and condensation surfaces, 
any surplus vapor above this value will condense as liquid water. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, engine icing tests cannot be conducted at conditions that are considered the critical
test points because of aircraft engine test facility operational constraints or the inability to
find the desired conditions in natural icing flight tests. The use of ice scaling laws may
circumvent this testing limitation. Earlier studies (Refs. 1 and 2) of the application of ice
scaling (similitude) to aircraft engine testing indicated that experimental data were needed
to determine to what extent icing test conditions [temperature (T), velocity (V), liquid water
content (LWC), median volume diameter (MVD), pressure (P)], could vary and still achieve
similar test results.
In this investigation, experimental data were gathered and analyzed to …</p></blockquote>

<p>Calibration methods evolved during the NACA-era</p>

<p>As implied from the quote above from the year 1929, 
the calibration of an icing wind tunnel is often not just measuring what the facility produces,

liquid water content, 
and producing a water drop spray that is uniform "enough". </p>

<li>An early icing wind tunnel with most of the components of current tunnels is described.  </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This investigation was conducted in the Refrigerated Wind
Tunnel at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley
Field, Virginia, to determine the effectiveness of various surface 
coatings as a means
for preventing ice formations on aircraft in flight.
The substances used as coatings for these tests are divided
into two groups:
compounds soluble in water, and those which are insoluble in water.
It was found that certain soluble compounds were apparently
effective in preventing the formation …</p></blockquote>

<p>While there were extensive publications on how to use aerodynamic wind tunnels in the NACA-era

<p>I briefly worked with Ramon Wilder (circa 1991?), 
but I did not ask him about this particular publication. 
I (a much junior engineer) did off-handedly ask him once about a certain heat conduction equation. 
He said "I'll get back to you." 
The next day he came in with a elegant, hand written, 10 page proof, and said 
"That was a little tough. It took me three hours last night!" 
That was the …</p>

<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION TO THE RESEARCH<br>
This report describes a continuation of research into the modeling of water particle
freezing for application to adverse weather simulation facilities. The research was initiated in
FY1996 to investigate the physics of freezing of submillimeter supercooled water particles or
droplets in both natural and artificial or simulated adverse weather environments. The first phase
of the research was reported and discussed in a report [1] and a paper [2]. The work has
continued into FY1997 and has been expanded to include work done to model three-dimensional
ice accretions …</p></blockquote>

<h1>Let's build a 1D water drop trajectory simulation</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Water impingement values on a cylinder are calculated with step-by-step integration. </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>1D equations of motion were implemented.  </li>
<li>Results agree well with the minimum drop size required for impingement.  </li>
<li>Water drops may contact the cylinder at very low K values.  </li>
<li>The methods appears accurate enough to use for other applications.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We are going to start with a one dimensional simulation along a single line,
the stagnation line of flow around a cylinder, y=0 in the figure above. </p>

<p>For the <a href="/icing-thermodynamics.html">Thermodynamics tread</a> and on, I will be using this style guide. 
Previous code may eventually be upgraded to this.</p>
<h1>Python target version:</h1>
<p>Target python version 3.7, and the corresponding <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda stack</a> (version 2021-11). 
Avoid modules with deprecation warnings (there are not many of them).
This is a balance between current installations and future-proofing. 
The goal is to be applicable for all 3.7+ uses. </p>
<p>(Note: 3.10 is the latest available version, as of April 2022).</p>
<p>Code should be portable, and not use operating system specific functions. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>simple</p>

<li>use simple functions over classes</li>
<li>out-source complexity where possible<ul>

small high-speed aircraft for which thermal anti-icing requirements 
have become severe.

<h3>Normal drop size distributions</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal distributions</a> show up many places in nature,

<p>Meteorological data from flight observations in icing conditions

<p>Veteran pilots with FIKI ratings (Flight In Known Icing) may already be familiar with this, but the rest of us could benefit from reading it.</p>

<p>Many new aircraft icing problems aren’t new at all. 
Like excavating a lost city, many surprises, answers to problems, 
road maps, and confirmations can be found in the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). 
This treasure trove of data can help you today. </p>
<p>Why care about aircraft icing?  If ice forms on a plane during flight, it can hazardous. 
Engineers research the weather conditions aircraft will encounter and work to ensure that 
they can navigate them safely. </p>
