<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The value of the multicylinder data for determining drop size distribution is questioned.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Two methods for determining drop size distributions are compared.  </li>
<li>The difference in water drop concentration around an aircraft body is proposed as an explanation for results from the two methods.  </li>
<li>A temperature effect of icing conditions is noted.  </li>
<li>Previously proposed design values from NACA-TN-1393 were verified.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Meteorological data from flight observations in icing conditions 
during the winter of 1946-47 are presented. Data on liquid
water content, temperature, and mean-effective drop diameter are
shown to be consistent with values previously proposed for maximum
icing conditions. Data on drop-size distribution as obtained by
the rotating-cylinder method, although consistent with measurements
previously made, were found to be inconsistent with data on drop-size 
distribution derived from the ratio of the maximum diameter
to the mean-effective diameter when the maximum diameter was
calculated from the area of impingement on a stationary cylinder.
The relation between temperature and maximum liquid water content
in layer clouds is discussed and estimates are given for the
highest values of water content to be expected in layer clouds at
various temperatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Over a period of several years, the NACA has conducted research 
on the prevention of ice formations on aircraft through the use of 
heat. The present phase of this research is intended to provide a 
fundamental understanding of the process of thermal ice prevention and 
thereby promote improvement in the design of thermal ice—prevention
equipment. The meteorological results of the investigation, up to<br>
and including the 1945-46 winter season, have been presented in 
reference 1. The present report, which may be regarded as a 
supplement to reference 1, presents the results of additional 
flight measurements made during the winter of 1946-47. These data<br>
include results of flight observations with the XB-24M and XB-25E<br>
airplanes operated by the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory at 
Cleveland, as well as the C-46 airplane operated by the Ames 
Aeronuutical Laboratory, Moffett Field, Calif.</p>
<p>Appreciation for cooperation in this investigation is extended 
to United Air Lines, Inc., the U.S. Weather Bureau, and the Air 
Materiel Command of the Army Air Forces. In particular, Major 
James Murray, Air Materiel Command, and Mr. Lyle Reynolds, United<br>
Air Lines, who were pilot and copilot, respectively, of the
C-46 airplane, contributed materially to the research program.</p>
<p>APPARATUS AND METHOD</p>
<p>The equipment and test methods employed in the research of this<br>
report were identical to those described in reference 1 with the 
exception of a few changes discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</p>
<p>The data from the 1946-47 observations have been prepared 
in a form similar to that used for presentation in reference 1.
Tables I and II present a summary of the data for both laboratories 
for all flights during which icing conditions were measured.
Figure 3 presents the relation between liquid water content and 
mean-effective drop diameter and figure 4 shows liquid water content
as a function of free—air temperature. The curves denoting intensity 
of icing in figure 3 represent the rate of ice accretion on a 3—inch 
diameter cylinder at 200 miles per hour as specified, by the
Weather Bureau for reporting icing intensity from mountain—top 
observation stations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typical Icing Conditions</p>
<p>Estimates of the most severe icing conditions likely to be 
 encountered in the course of all-weather transport operations in 
 the United States have been presented in the foregoing section. 
 Data on typical or average icing conditions and an the relative 
 frequency of various values of liquid water content.and drop size 
 are also of interest.<br>
   The highest values of liquid water content measured during each 
 of 21 flights in cumulus clouds, 51 flights in layer-type clouds 
 are presented in figure 5 in the form of ogives (cumulative frequency 
 curves, reference 4). These curves include data from the Ames 
 Aeronautical Laboratory for 1945-46 and 1946-47 and from the Flight 
 Propulsion Research Laboratory for 1946-47. The median value of 
maximum liquid water content per flight is 0.76 gram per cubic meter 
for cumulus clouds and 0.28 gram per cubic meter for layer clouds. 
 These values approximate those given in reference 1 for typical
 icing conditions. It is also noted from figure 5 that 90 percent 
 of the flights in cumulus clouds encountered less than 1.2 grams 
per cubic meter and 90 percent of the flights in layer clouds 
encountered less than 0.5 gram per cubic meter.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.png" src="images%2Fnaca-tn-1424%2FFigure%205.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ogives plotted from observations of mean-effective diameter 
and maximum diameter made during the 1946-47 season are presented 
in figure 6. It is noted that 50 percent of the observations of 
mean-effective diameter fall in the relatively narrow range from 
11.2 to 16.2 Microns; and 90 percent are less than 22 microns. 
Fifty percent of the observations of maximum diameter are between 
12.6 and 20 microns and 90 percent are below 28 microns.<br>
   These distribution curves indicate that the icing conditions 
most commonly encountered are much less severe than the estimated 
maximum conditions. Thus, if it were assumed that most cumulus 
clouds and the most severe 10 percent of icing conditions in layer 
clouds could be avoided by proper meteorological navigation, it 
would only be necessary to protect against 0.5 gram per cubic meter 
at 13 microns or 0.3 grim per cubic meter at 20 microns. The extent 
to which meteorological navigation can be relied upon, however, can 
only be determined by an extensive study of the distribution of 
icing conditions in various weather situations and an analysis of 
air traffic control procedures.</p>

<h3>Drops size distributions</h3>
<p>The drop size distributions definitions and cylinder impingement analysis methods from <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> are used.  </p>
<p>A comparison of two methods of determining the drop size distribution yielded rather different results.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maximum Drop Size and Drop—Size Distribution<br>
    In the analysis of the test data the fact as noted that, in 
many cases, the maximum drop diameter as calculated from the area 
of impingement on the fixed cylinder was equal to or only slightly 
exceeded the corresponding mean—effective diameter calculated from 
the rotating—cylinder data. In a few cases the indicated maximum 
diameter was less than the indicated mean—effective diameter. This
would indicate that in a majority of cases the size distribution was 
fairly uniform. The size distribution obtained by the rotating-cylinder 
method, on the other hand, frequently indicated broad 
distributions in cases where the comparison of the mean and the 
maximum diameters indicated uniform drop size. In order to check 
the consistency of these two methods of measuring drop—size 
distribution, they were expressed in terms of a common scale. To
do this the assumption was made that the value of drop diameter 
contributing 10 percent of the water content in the assumed size 
distributions B, C, D, and E (reference 2) corresponds to the value 
of maximum drop diameter derived from the area of impingement on
the stationary cylinder. Or the basis of this assumption, the ratio 
of the maximum diameter as measured by the area of impingcnent method 
to the mean—effective diameter as measured by the rotating—cylinder 
method was used to define a scale of size distributions as follows:</p>

<h3>Effect of the aircraft body on drop concentrations</h3>
<p>A possible explanation for the differences was the positions of the instruments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible explanation for this discrepency in the determination of 
drop—size distribution lies in the effect of the acceleration 
in the flow of air around the fuselage in locally modifying the water 
content, drop—size distribution, and velocity at the points where
the rotating cylinders are exposed. Since the 1/8-inch cylinder
is exposed nearly twice as far from the side of the fuselage as the 
3-inch cylinder, it would appear that the local effects might apply 
variously to the different cylinders, thus giving rise to a false 
relationship between cylinder diameter and relative collection 
efficiency. Only a small change in the curvature of the line 
defining this relationship is sufficient to produce a significant 
change in the indicated drop-size distribution. This effect could 
be measured by the exposure of four rotating cylinders of equal 
diameters at positions normally occupied by the rotating cylinders. 
Any differences in the amounts of ice collected would be due to the 
local acceleration effects just mentioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even with the differences in drop size distributions, it was noted in the conclusion that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In spite of the inconsistency it is believed that the data on mean-effective diameters are fairly reliable.</p>
