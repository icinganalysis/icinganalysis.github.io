<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice was formed on a full-scale unheated supersonic nose inlet in the
NACA Lewis icing tunnel to determine its effect on compressor-face total-pressure 
distortion and recovery. Inlet angle of attack was varied from
0° to 12°, free-stream Mach number from 0.17 to 0.28, and compressor-face
Mach number from 0.10 to 0.47. Icing-cloud liquid-water content was
varied from 0.65 to 1.8 grams per cubic meter at free-stream static air
temperatures of 15° and 0° F.  </p>
<p>The addition of ice to the inlet components increased total-pressure-
distortion levels and decreased recovery values compared with clear-air
results, the losses increasing with time in ice. The combination of
glaze ice, high corrected weight flow, and high angle of attack yielded
the highest levels of distortion and lowest values of recovery. The
general character of compressor-face distortion with an iced inlet was
the same as that for the clean inlet, the total-pressure gradients being
predominantly radial, with circumferential gradients occurring at angle
of attack.  </p>
<p>At zero angle of attack, free-stream Mach number of 0.27, and a
constant corrected weight flow of 150 pounds per second (compressor-face
Mach number of 0.43), compressor-face total-pressure-distortion level
increased from about 6 percent in clear air to 12 percent after 21
minutes of heavy glaze icing; concurrently, total-pressure recovery decreased 
from about 0.98 to 0.945. For the same operating conditions but
with the inlet at 12° angle of attack, a change in distortion level
occurred from about 9 percent in clear air to 14 percent after 2 minutes
of icing, with a decrease in recovery from about 0.97 to 0.94.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>APPARATUS  </p>
<p>Model and Installation  </p>
<p>A front view of the supersonic-nose-inlet model installed in the
6- by 9-foot test section of the Lewis icing tunnel is shown in figure 1.
The over-all length of the installation was about 20 feet, with a main
support pedestal located near the midpoint. Additional support was provided 
by an A-frame just aft of the inlet lips. A prototype (full-scale)
inlet was used for the first few feet of the external cowling and the
first 7 feet within the inlet model (forward of the compressor-face
station). The aft 13 feet of the installation contained the ejector
nozzles and ducting used to simulate the pumping action of an engine
compressor.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%201.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conical centerbody was supported by three equally spaced swept-back 
struts mounted from the outer shell or cowling, as indicated by the
schematic drawing of the inlet and afterbody in figure 2(a). The over-all
top view of figure 2(a) shows the inlet at 12° angle of attack. Because
of the model and tunnel size, only the forward half of the installation
was at angle of attack relative to the free stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%202.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The front-view schematic drawing of the inlet shown in figure 2(a)
indicates the positions of the three centerbody struts and the sub-inlet
as mounted in the tunnel. This sub-inlet, which provides air for oil-cooling, 
is one of three included in the prototype design. A side view
of the sub-inlet (located between stations 35 and 104) is also shown.
Airflow through the sub-inlet is independently controlled by two ejector
nozzles (one shown) and a butterfly valve. A front-view photograph of
the inlet model showing the support struts and sub-inlet is given in
figure 2(b).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2b.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%202b.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 2(c) presents the annular flow areas within the main inlet
from the cowl-lip station 1.9 to the compressor-face station 85. These
flow areas at any nacelle station, which are calculated on the assumption
that the airflow across the annulus is parallel to the mean radius at that
station, account for the presence of the centerbody support struts.
Significant airflow areas are: inlet lips (station 1.9), 4.576 square
feet; inlet throat (station 20), 3.40 square feet; and compressor face
(station 85), 4.549 square feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2c.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%202c.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As shown in figure 3, model instrumentation consisted of 16 rake's
(electrically heated coaxial pressuretubes) and 16 flush wall static
taps, eight on the centerbody and eight on the cowl inner wall. All model
instrumentation was at the simulated compressor face (station 85); a
photograph looking upstream at this station is shown in figure 3(a).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF DATA  </p>
<p>The effect of mode of operation in evaluating compressor-face airflow
distortion and pressure recovery resulting from iced inlet components is
illustrated in figure 4. This figure is a schematic representation of
typical total-pressure distortion and recovery data as a function of
corrected weight flow. The dashed curves for zero icing time (clear air)
indicate the usual trends of distortion increases and recovery decreases
with increased corrected weight flow (refs 5 and 7). Similar but more
pronounced trends are noted for the dashed curves for 5 minutes in icing
(fixed free-stream icing condition). The solid lines connecting the
symbols (number beside each data symbol denotes minutes of icing at a
fixed free-stream condition) represent data obtained from a typical
tunnel mode of operation. For the tunnel mode, corrected weight flow
decreases with icing time; concurrently, distortion and recovery continue
to increase and decrease, respectively. Generally, a change in the
free-stream icing condition will shift the curves of constant icing time
for all icing times greater than 0. Also indicated in figure 4 is the
inlet-throat (station 20, fig. 2(c)) choking limit (assuming no losses).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With an engine operating at a constant corrected engine speed, the
curve for engine mode of operation would be vertical at a particular
constant value of corrected weight flow (dotted line, fig. 4). The shaded
areas in figure 4 emphasize the range of divergence between the tunnel
mode of operation (solid line) and the engine mode of operation (dotted
vertical line). Changes in distortion and pressure recovery with icing
time are increased by the engine mode of operation as compared with the
tunnel mode. By presenting data for total-pressure distortion and
recovery in the form of figure 4, interpretation of results is not
completely restricted to the tunnel mode of operation, and a reasonable
approximation of losses at constant corrected weight flow (engine mode of
operation) is possible.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   </p>
<p>Total-pressure distortion and recovery as functions of corrected
weight flow are presented in figure 5 for all conditions studied herein.
Figures 5(a) to (d) depict four different free-stream icing conditions
with the inlet model at zero angle of attack. For a particular icing
condition, the effects of angle of attack are illustrated in figures 5(e),
(g), arid (h), for angles of 12°, 8°, and 4°, respectively. For 12° angle
of attack, figure 5(f) presents data for a less severe icing condition
than that shown in figure 5(e). The effects of corrected weight flow,
free-stream icing condition, icing time, angle of attack, and mode of
operation are obtained from a study of the data in figure 5. These effects
are isolated and presented separately in the following discussion.</p>

<p>Icing Results  </p>
<p>The glaze-ice formations of run 1 are considerably larger than the
rime-ice formations of run 4 and cause more disturbances to the inlet
airflow, as reflected in the tabulated values of distortion and recovery
and in the corresponding total-pressure-contour maps. Except for the
local flow disturbances caused by the 3 o'clock support strut and the
sub-inlet between the 4 and 5 o'clock positions previously discussed, the
total-pressure contours are generally symmetrical, with radial gradients
or distortion. At zero icing time the pressure gradients are most severe
near the cowl wall. With time in icing the gradients increase near the
cowl and centerbody and extend farther into the flow annulus, thereby
reducing the area of high pressure recovery. The photographs and pressure-contour 
maps for glaze-icing run 1 in figure 9(a) are typical of those
obtained for the other glaze-icing runs 2 and 6 (figs. 5(a) and (c),
respectively). Likewise, figure 9(b) for run 4 is typical for the other
rime-icing runs 5 and 7 (figs. 5(b) and (d), respectively).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of a glaze and a rime cowl-lip ice formation at nearly
the same inlet velocity ratio is illustrated by figures 11(a) and (c).
The smoother rime formation of figure 11(c) results in distortion and
pressure-recovery values of [15 percent] and [0.945], respectively, an
improvement over the comparable glaze formation values of [20 percent]
and [0.915]. Compressor-face distortion and recovery for the rime ice
formation (fig. 11(c)) are also an improvement over those obtained at
the higher inlet velocity ratio with glaze ice (fig. 11(b)). The
distortion and pressure-recovery values also include the effects of ice
formations on the centerbody and support struts, while only cowl-lip ice
is illustrated by the sketches. However, the contour plots of figure 9
indicate that cowl-lip disturbances are the more controlling factor.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Concluding Remarks  </p>
<p>Compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery are closely
related to the particular design and operation of an inlet in clear air
or in icing, and the type and location of inlet ice are important factors.
Under certain icing and operating conditions the data herein indicate that
ice formations on an engine inlet cause increased distortions that may
result in significant thrust reductions and surge or stall problems, based
on previous data. These penalties to engine performance may be approximated 
from the data presented herein for an engine with known distortion
tolerance.  </p>
<p>Although there was little breakoff of ice from the inlet components
during these studies, the danger of ice breakoff and ingestion by the
engine exists and should be considered with reference to elimination of
an inlet icing-protection system. Thus, the possible penalties regarding
engine performance and engine damage accruing from inlet icing are such
as to favor icing protection for the inlet unless the particular configuration 
or flight plan reduces the risks of no protection to an acceptable
level.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>The effects on compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery
of ice formations on the unheated supersonic nose inlet studied are
summarized as follows: <br>
1. The addition of ice to the inlet components resulted in increased
distortion levels and reduced pressure recovery compared with clear-air
values, the losses increasing with time in icing.<br>
2. The compressor-face flow losses were greatest for the higher
corrected weight flows and angles of attack and for glaze-ice formations.
After a few minutes of glaze icing the effects of angle of attack on
distortion level and recovery are minimized.<br>
3. The general character of compressor-face distortion with an iced
inlet was the same as that for the clean inlet except for steeper pressure
gradients (distortion patterns). The pressure gradients with the inlet
studied were predominantly radial, with circumferential gradients occurring
at angle of attack.<br>
4. From a constant-corrected-weight-flow (150 lb/sec, compressor-face 
Mach number of 0.43) interpretation of the tunnel data, total-pressure 
distortion increased from about 6 percent in clear air to 12
percent after 2 minutes of heavy glaze icing. Concurrently, total-pressure 
recovery decreased from about 0.98 to 0.945. These results are
for the inlet studied at 0° angle of attack, a free-stream Mach number
of 0.27, a liquid-water content of 1.3 grams per cubic meter, a droplet
diameter of 16 microns, and a free-stream static air temperature of 15° F. <br>
For comparable operating conditions but with the inlet at 12° angle
of attack, a change in distortion level occurred from about 9 percent in
clear air to 14 percent after 2 minutes of icing, with a decrease in
pressure recovery from about 0.97 to 0.94.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more recent turbofan designs, 
the engine itself may have few components heated for ice protection, 
but the engine inlet leading edges ("lips") generally do have ice protection.</p>
