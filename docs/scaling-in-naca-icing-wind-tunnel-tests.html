<h3>NACA-RM-E8A27 "Ice Protection of Turbojet Engines by Inertia Separation of Water, I - Alternate-Duct System" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h3>
<p>This is the earliest example that I have found of using dimensionless water drop impingement terms for 
test similarity calculations.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of a preliminary investigation of internal water-
inertia separation inlets designed to prevent automatically the
entrance of large quantities of water into a turbojet engine in
icing conditions are presented. A simplified analytical approach
to the design of internal water-inertia separation inlets is
included. The analysis is applied specifically to the model
investigated.<br>
The results show that to be effective in separating the free
water from the air stream in order to prevent screen and stator-blade 
icing, an inlet of this type had a 75-percent ram-pressure
recovery at the design inlet-velocity ratio in an icing condition.
For normal nonicing operation, the ram-pressure recovery is comparable 
to a direct-ram installation The ram-pressure recovery
and the circumferential uniformity of the mass flow in the inlets
was relatively independent of angle of attack.</p>

<p>Extrapolation of model icing investigations to full scale. </p>
<p>If the values of the K and φ parameters (where K = f( a<sup>^2</sup> V / C)
and φ = f( ρ<sup>^2</sup> V C)) for the model and full-scale nacelle are maintained 
the same, the icing characteristics of the model will be
similar to the icing characteristics of the full-scale nacelle as
determined by Langmuir and Blodgett.
Each component of a complicated duct system will have its own K and φ values; however 
by choosing the most important component for a particular investigation a satisfactory 
extrapolation to full scale can be attained.
The calculations of K and φ contain four important variables:
velocity, drop diameter, body dimension, and density, which can
be varied simultaneously, separately, or in combination.
For the investigation presented, the data were extrapolated
from half scale to full scale by holding K constant and so
changing the density or pressure altitude for the full-scale
nacelle that φ<sub>m</sub> for the half-scale model was the same as φ<sub>f</sub>
The half-scale model conditions for these investigations thus
pertain to full-scale conditions at a pressure altitude of approximately 21,000 feet.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>where a is water drop diameter 
      V is air speed
      C is chord length
      ρ is air density
      μ is air viscosity
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using an analogy such as Re = ρVC/μ, a subscale test value of C may be compensated for by
increasing ρ or V (or in combination) to maintain a full scale flight Re value. 
Facilities such as the Variable-Density Wind Tunnel (<a href="/naca-tr-446.html">see NACA-TR-446</a>) can be pressurized to achieve a high density. 
Here, the water drop impingement dimensionless terms K and φ are used. </p>
<p>The dimensionless terms K and φ that describe water drop impingement come from <a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Langmuir and Blodgett</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>,
but Langmuir and Blodgett were not included in the references of NACA-RM-E8A27.  </p>
<p>The IRT is not pressurized, so the test section pressure will be close to sea level pressure.
Thus, a test with a half scale test article in a close to sea level pressure facility
is related full scale flight at altitude. </p>
<p>The example does not detail all of the four key variables for the flight and test cases
required to maintain the same K = f( a<sup>^2</sup> V / C) and φ = f( ρ<sup>^2</sup> V C) values. 
At 21,000 ft. the air density is about 0.5 that of sea level 
(if using a standard atmosphere table, the density would be less if temperature was held constant). 
Here are relative values that maintain the K and φ values. 
There is more than one flight set that corresponds to the test values. </p>

<p>The first flight set appears to be what was described in the example, 
but the flight velocity being twice the test value was not mentioned. 
The second flight set scales drop size, but uses the same velocity as the test. 
The K = f( a<sup>^2</sup> V / C) = 2 value cannot be achieved with a, V, and C all being 1.</p>
<p>This illustrates a challenge of scaling: 
scaling one dimensional parameter often requires scaling at least one other 
dimensional parameter (sometimes several) to keep a dimensionless parameter value constant. </p>
<h3>NACA-RM-E50E03, "Investigation of Aerodynamic and Icing Characteristics of Water-Inertia-Separation Inlets for Turbojet Engines" <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h3>
<p>This considers testing a subscale model at sea level pressure and comparing

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY
The results of an investigation of several internal water-
inertia-separation inlets consisting of a main duct and an alternate 
duct designed to prevent automatically the entrance of large
quantities of water into a turbojet engine in icing conditions are
presented. Total-pressure losses and icing characteristics for a
direct-ram inlet and the inertia-separation inlets are compared at
similar aerodynamic and simulated icing conditions.
Complete ice protection for inlet guide vanes could not be
achieved with the inertia-separation inlets investigated. Approximately 
8 percent of the volume of water entering the nacelles
remained. In the air passing into the compressor inlet, heavy
alternate-duct-elbow ice formations caused by secondary inertia
separation resulted in rapid total-pressure losses and decreases
in mass flow. The duration in an icing condition for an inertia-separation 
inlet, without local surface heating, was increased
approximately four times above that for a direct-ram inlet with a
compressor-inlet screen. For normal nonicing operation, the 
inertia-separation-inlet total-pressure losses were comparable to a direct-ram 
installation. The pressure losses and the circumferential uniformity 
of the mass flow in all the inlets were relatively independent of angle of attack. 
Use of an inertia-separation inlet
would in most cases require a larger diameter nacelle than a direct-ram 
inlet in order to obtain an alternate duct sufficiently large
to pass the required engine air flow at duct Mach numbers below
1.0 at the minimum area.</p>
<p>For full-scale considerations, the alternate-duct
area must therefore be increased to an extent that it would pass
sufficient air to the engine at a reasonable Mach number and pressure loss. 
This design requirement could be attained with configuration E by 
increasing the inlet gap about 26 percent and then
scaling the entire configuration to fit the engine. 
An increase
in the inlet gap, however, does not appear to be feasible for good
water separation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The test demonstrated the feasibility of water separation inlet design, 
but the specific design tested does not appear to be feasible for flight. </p>
<p>This illustrates another challenge of scaling and test in a ground level, 
limited Mach range facility. </p>
<h3>NACA-RM-E56E11, "Use of Truncated Flapped Airfoils for Impingement and Icing Tests of Full-Scale Leading-Edge Sections" <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></h3>
<p>The use of truncated airfoils is described. 
Keeping a full scale leading edge avoids geometric scaling in test similarity calculations, 
but allows smaller test articles to keep within the physical limits 
of the test facility. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to increase the operational range of existing small
icing tunnels, the use of truncated airfoil sections has been suggested.
With truncated airfoils, large-scale or even full-scale wing-icing-
protection systems could be evaluated. Therefore, experimental studies
were conducted in the NACA Lewis laboratory icing tunnel with an NACA
651-212 airfoil section to determine the effect of truncating the airfoil 
chord on velocity distribution and impingement characteristics. A
6-foot-chord airfoil was cut successively at the 50- and 30-percent-chord
stations to produce the truncated airfoil sections, which were equipped
with trailing-edge flaps that were used to alter the flow field about
the truncated sections. The study was conducted at geometric angles of
attack of 0° and 4°, an airspeed of about 156 knots, and volume-median
droplet sizes of 11.5 and 18.6 microns. A dye-tracer technique was used
in the impingement studies.  </p>
<p><strong>With the trailing-edge flap on the truncated airfoil deflected so
that the local velocity distribution in the impingement region was 
substantially the same as that for the full-chord airfoil, the local impingement 
rates and the limits of impingement for the truncated and full-chord 
airfoils were the same.</strong> In general, truncating the airfoils with
flaps undeflected resulted in a substantially altered velocity distribution 
and local impingement rates compared with those of the full-chord
airfoil. The use of flapped truncated airfoils may permit impingement
and icing studies to be conducted with full-scale leading-edge sections,
ranging in size from tip to root sections.</p>
