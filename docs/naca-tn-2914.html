<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The warmest ambient temperature at which ice can accumulate is calculated.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The warmest ambient temperature at which ice can accumulate is calculated.  </li>

<li>Analysis showed good results compared to test data at transonic Mach numbers. </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Calculations have been made for the icing limit of a diamond airfoil 
at zero angle of attack in terms of the stream Mach number, stream
temperature, and pressure altitude. The icing limit is defined as a
wetted-surface temperature of 32F and is related to the stream conditions 
by the method of Hardy.<br>
The results show that the point most likely to ice on the airfoil
lies immediately behind the shoulder and is subject to possible icing
at Mach numbers as high as 1.4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>NACA-TN-2861</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects of existing frictional heating were analyzed to determine 
the conditions under which ice formations on aircraft surfaces can
be prevented. A method is presented for rapidly determining by means
of charts the combination of Mach number, altitude, and stream temperature 
which will maintain an ice-free surface in an icing cloud. The
method can be applied to both subsonic and supersonic flow. The charts
presented are for Mach numbers up to 1.8 and pressure altitudes from sea
level to 45,000 feet.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is review includes NACA-TN-2861 and NACA-TN-2914. 
They have the same authors, and contain much of the same theoretic material. 
NACA-TN-2861 includes experimental data for comparison. 
NACA-TN-2914 includes more analysis cases. </p>
<p><img alt="Symbols" src="images/NACA-TN-2914/Symbols.png"></p>
<p>Equations from Hardy (<a href="/naca-arr-5g13.html">NACA-ARR-5G13</a>) <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> are 
used.

<blockquote>
<p>Because interest in this problem is fixed on a definition of flight
circumstances that provide local surface temperatures of 32°F, the
terms Ts, L, and es are constants. Hardy observed (reference 1) that
for the range of temperatures near 32°F the ratio of the evaporation
coefficient ke to the heat-transfer coefficient kh was very nearly 1. 
A solution of equation (1) can be obtained for any one of the four
variables (el, pl, Ml, and Tl) provided the other three are known.
From purely physical reasoning, however, an additional restriction exists.
This restriction results from the fact that the air in a cloud is fully
saturated at the static or free-stream conditions. For each value of
stream-static temperature, the free-stream vapor pressure is therefore
assumed a constant and equal to the saturated vapor pressure. If it is
assumed that the flow about the body, outside the boundary layer, is
accomplished with no change in phase, that is, no condensation or 
evaporation, then Dalton's law of partial pressures applies and</p>

<p><img alt="Equation 2 continued" src="images/NACA-TN-2914/Discussion_after_equation2_continued.png"> </p>
<p>Equation (1a) in NACA-TN-2861 is the same as equation (2) in NACA-TN-2914. </p>
<p>Note that the heat or mass transfer coefficients do not need to be evaluated,
just the ratio ke/kh, which was assumed to be 1. 
No assumption about laminar or turbulent flow is required, 
except in the selection of the recovery factor value. </p>
<p>Note also that an impingement rate is not calculated. 
So, the water drop size and liquid water content values do not have to be known. 
It is assumed that there is enough water to wet the entire surface. 
The is no partial surface wettedness as was considered in <a href="/naca-tn-2799.html">NACA-TN-2799</a> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. </p>

<p>NACA-TN-2861 describes a test that was run:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the coefficient of pressure or pl/po ratios were not included,
so a comparison for this case was not run. </p>
<p>In NACA-TN-2914 more complete examples were provided. </p>
<p>An implementation of the calculations in the python file "naca_tn_2914.py" <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> was used to compared results. </p>

<p>Example I. - Calculation is made of the free-stream static temperature 
required for an ice-free surface as a function of Mach number for
an NACA 65-206 airfoil at 15,000 feet pressure altitude and 1° angle of
attack.
The velocity ratio can be found for this airfoil by the
methods and results presented in reference 5. The maximum velocity ratio
(minimum pressure ratio) for this airfoil was determined to be
Vl/Vo = 1.139 and occurs at the 45-percent chord station on the upper
surface. Assuming a value of the recovery factor of 0.85 and that the
surface is wet at this point determines toc, in the following way:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>NACA-TN-2861: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The results of the analysis of icing limit presented for the
diamond airfoil at zero angle of attack in the transonic-supersonic
speed range are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The critical point for the whole airfoil in terms of the icing
limit was located immediately behind the shoulder. The critical point
on the front surface was located immediately ahead of the shoulder.
The results indicate that icing may occur at the critical point behind
the shoulder for Mach numbers as high as 1.4. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a constant free-stream Mach number and airfoil thickness, the
minimum free-stream static temperature corresponding to an ice-free
condition increases with increasing altitude. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the point immediately ahead of the shoulder the minimum
free-stream temperature corresponding to an ice-free condition remains
the same or decreases with increasing thickness ratio at a constant
value of Mach number and altitude. For the point immediately down-stream 
of the shoulder the free-stream temperature corresponding to
an ice-free condition increases with increasing thickness at a constant
Mach number and altitude.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>NACA-TN-2914 did not have a "conclusions" section.</p>
<h3>Can ice form at T_ambient = 0C?</h3>
<p>An interesting question is can ice form when the ambient static temperature is the melting point of ice, 0C? 
The calculations from NACA-TN-2914 predict yes, over a range of conditions:</p>
<p><img alt="Cp values calculated" src="images/NACA-TN-2914/naca-tn-2914_cp_for_0c.png">  </p>
<p>The examples in NACA-TN-2914 did not have coefficient of pressure values in this range, 
but they are not unrealistic for other airfoils at some flight conditions. 
It is not clear that the location of the coefficient of pressure values would be in the impingement zone, 
and that the assumption of a fully wet surface would apply. </p>
