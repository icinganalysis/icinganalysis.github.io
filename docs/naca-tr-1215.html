<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Conditions where not all water drops freeze are considered.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>NACA-TN-2903, NACA-TN-2904, and NACA-RM-E53D23 are "superseded" (collected together).</li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Evaluation of the rotating multicylinder method for the
measurement of droplet-size distribution, volume-median droplet
size, and liquid-water content in clouds showed that small 
uncertainties in the basic data eliminate the distinction between
different cloud droplet-size distributions and are a source of
large errors in the determination of the droplet size. Calculations 
of the trajectories of cloud droplets in incompressible and
compressible flow fields around a cylinder were performed on a
mechanical analog constructed for the study of the trajectories of
droplets around aerodynamic bodies. Many data points were
carefully calculated in order to determine precisely the rate of
droplet impingement on the surfme of a right circular cylinder.
From the computed droplet trajectories, the following impingement 
characteristics of the cylinder surface were obtained and
are presented in terms of dimensionless parameters: (1) total
rate of water impingement, (2) extent of droplet impingement
zone, and (3) local distribution of impinging water on cylinder
surface.</p>
<p>The rotating multicylinder method for in-flight determination
of liquid-water content, droplet size, and droplet-size distribution
in icing clouds is described. The theory of operation, the
apparatus required, the technique of obtaining data in fight,
and detailed methods of calculating the results, including
necessary charts and tables, are presented. An evaluation of
the multicylinder method includes the effect on final results of
droplets that do not freeze completely on the cylinders after
striking them, as well as probable errors in final results caused
by the inherent insensitivity of the multicylinder method.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>"supersedes" NACA-TN-2903, NACA-TN-2903, and NACA-RM-E53D23</h3>
<p>NACA-TR-1215 "supersedes" NACA-TN-2903 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, NACA-TN-2903 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, and NACA-RM-E53D23 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. 
Large portions of each of those is reproduced in NACA-TR-1215, 
and will not be reiterated here. 
Detail-oriented readers will want to view those reviews: 
<a href="/naca-tn-2903.html">NACA-TN-2903</a>, 
<a href="/naca-tn-2904.html">NACA-TN-2904</a>, 
<a href="/naca-rm-e53d23.html">NACA-RM-E53D23</a>. 
And due to the compact, two-column print format of NACA-TR-1215, 
many of the figures are more legible in the three forerunners. </p>
<p>I did not find where anything significant was deleted from the three. 
So supersede does not appear to mean over-riding or deprecating.
Rather, NACA-TR-1215 collects them and adds to them.</p>
<p>However, note that the three are conspicuously missing from the references of NACA-TR-1215, 
(although they appear in a footnote),
perhaps implying that there would be no need to look at them again?
Brun was an author on all four publications. </p>
<h3>droplets that do not freeze completely</h3>
<p>The significant part that NACA-TR-1215 adds 
is the effect of of water drops that do not completely freeze. 
Building on the work of Ludlam <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> and others, an analysis method was detailed in Appendix F.</p>
<p><img alt="Six detailed assumptions about ice formation on a cylinder." src="images/naca-tr-1215/Assumptions.png"></p>
<p>A detailed explanation of the equations in Appendix F is quite involved, 
and will be deferred to the thread on thermodynamics, <a href="/naca-tr-1215-thermodynamics.html">NACA-TR-1215 Thermodynamics</a>. </p>
<p>To put the analysis results in terms useful for multicylinder analysis, 
the ambient liquid water content is split into the portions that freeze, evaporate, 
and liquid water that does not freeze and presumably runs off of the cylinder. 
The term LWC_freeze*Em (or wf*Em) is proportional to the rotating cylinder ice mass, 
and it is plotted with cylinder diameter, similar to the plots used for the manual 
determination of best fit MVD, LWC and distribution that we have seen previously.</p>
<p>What is added is a "critical" line, which is a calculated limit for freezing all of the 
available water, using the equations from Appendix F. </p>
<p>Note that critical line is a function of airspeed, temperature, and altitude,
and that there are unique values for each cylinder diameter, 
even though each cylinder is flying through the same conditions. </p>
<p>Also added is a "run-off" line:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For observations in discontinuous clouds, points representing 
critical or super-critical conditions lie approximately along a line called the
"run-off line," which is located parallel to and generally
below the critical line, because the effect on the average
value of wf*Ew of the term containing λ is nearly always
smaller than the effect of discontinuities (gaps) in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The term λ is explained further below).</p>
<p>Figure 24 shows cases where the cylinder masses are well below the critical line (a),
some masses are affected (b and c), and all cylinders (d).  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 24. Example illustrating effect of run-off on multi-cylinder data." src="images/naca-tr-1215/Figure24.png"></p>
<p>Data affected by run-off may still be useful in some circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If multicylinder data taken under conditions of partial
run-off are analyzed by the ordinary method without reference 
to the possible occurrence of run-off, the results usually
indicate values of liquid-water content that are too small
and values of mean effective droplet diameter that are too
large. This occurs because, under ordinary flight and cloud
conditions, run-off occurs first from the smallest cylinders.
For very large droplets, on the other hand, run-off occurs
first from the largest cylinder and thus would tend to cause
underestimation of the droplet size.</p>
<p>The methods described in the preceding paragraphs make
possible the attainment of satisfactory results in many cases
in which one or two cylinders are affected by run-off. Observations 
from which reliable results are unobtainable can
also be recognized and rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Freezing fraction</h3>
<p>NACA-TR-1215 includes a "freezing fraction" term, I believe for the first time in the NACA series.</p>
<p><img alt="Freezing fraction definitions" src="images/naca-tr-1215/freezing_fraction.png"> </p>
<p>Note that the term is defined on a mass basis (F17) and then transformed to an energy basis (36).</p>
<p>Here, the term is credited to Fraser <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> ("reference 18"), which was published in August, 1952.</p>
<p>The term is generally credited to <a href="/messinger.html">Messinger</a> <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>, which was published in a journal in January, 1953. 
However, Messinger had presented the paper at a meeting in 1951. 
Also, Messinger's freezing fraction is different. 
In this nomenclature, Messinger's freezing fraction is λ = wf / w. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, Messinger is referenced only once (NACA-TN-2861) in the NACA publications, 
even though it was contemporaneous, at least for the later NACA works. 
Messinger is the second most cited of any aircraft icing publication that I know of, 
second only to Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> (732 citations versus 741 <sup id="fnref2:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>).</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The often noted laments about the limitations of the multicylinder method 
are repeated yet again, 
but it is also noted that it was still the most "reliable" technique.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the rotating multicylinder method for measurements 
in icing clouds has several inherent undesirable 
characteristics, it is considered to be the most reliable technique
known at this time that is adaptable to flight use. The meteorological 
data obtained with the multicylinder method are
the only data available for the design of ice-protection equipment 
for aircraft. An important deficiency of the method lies
in its insensitivity in discriminating and resolving droplet-size 
distributions. The differences among the droplet-size 
distributions are masked by the scattering of the measured data
due to errors in measurements, by differences between
assumed theoretical conditions and those actually prevailing
in the natural cloud, and by errors in the calculations.  </p>
<p>Even though the effect of compressibility of the air on the
droplet trajectories is negligible, the airplane speed should be
maintained as low as possible in obtaining flight data, because
the final results are most accurate at low speeds. Also, the
limitations of ice-accretion rate caused by kinetic heating and
heat of fusion are less severe at low airspeeds. Multicylinder
results obtained with limitations on ice-accretion rates may
be in error by a magnitude as large as the measurements, if
the effect of run-off is not evaluated. Run-off is a factor in
determining the volume-median droplet size and the liquid-water 
content. If run-off is not recognized in the analysis of
the data, the measured data points are incorrectly matched
to the theoretically calculated matching curves.  </p>
<p>Different forms of the multicylinder instruments are discussed 
in reference 25, along with the effects of yaw, ice
density, and other factors on the reliability of data and the
reproducibility of measurements for conditions on a
mountain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Reference 25" is NACA-TN-2708 (previous review: <a href="/naca-tn-2708.html">NACA-TN-2708</a>).</p>
<p>NACA-TR-1215 superseded NACA-TN-2904, 
but NACA-TN-2904 is cited more often (54 citations) than NACA-TR-1215 (12 citations <sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>).
Some of the difference (11 citations) is due to NACA-TN-2904 predating NACA-TR-1215 by about two years, 
but many of the citations occur after NACA-TR-1215 was published. 
If "supersede" was intended to mean "make obsolete", it did not have that effect. </p>
<p>The thermodynamics of NACA-TR-1215 are reviewed in more detail in <a href="/naca-tr-1215-thermodynamics.html">NACA-TR-1215-Thermodynamics</a>.  </p>
