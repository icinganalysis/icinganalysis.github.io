<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Data about the horizontal and vertical extend of icing clouds.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>A factor of distance traveled in icing related to liquid water content is noted.  </li>

<li>"Observations ... during the 1948-49 and 1949-50 winters were in substantial agreement with values previously reported."  </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Liquid-water content, droplet size, and temperature data measured 
during 22 flights in predominantly stratiform clouds through the
1948-49 and the 1949-50 winters are presented. Several icing encounters 
were of greater severity than those previously measured over the
same geographical area, but were within the limits of similar measurements 
obtained over different terrain within the United States.
An analysis of meteorological conditions existing during the
74 flights conducted for four winters indicated an inverse relation 
of liquid-water concentration to maximum horizontal extent of
icing clouds. Data on the vertical extent of supercooled clouds
are also presented. Icing conditions were most likely to occur in
the southwest and northwest quadrants of a cyclone area, and least
likely to occur in the southeast and northeast quadrants where convergent 
air flow and lifting over the associated warm frontal surface 
usually cause precipitation. Additional data indicated that,
icing conditions were usually encountered in nonprecipitating
clouds existing at subfreezing temperatures and were unlikely over
areas where most weather observing stations reported the existence
of precipitation. Measurements of liquid-water content obtained
during 12 flights near the time and location of radiosonde observations 
were compared with theoretical values. The average liquid-water 
content of a cloud layer, as measured by the multicylinder
technique, seldom exceeded two-thirds of that which could be released
by adiabatic lifting. Local areas near the cloud tops equaled or
occasionally exceeded the calculated maximum quantity of liquid water.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>One phase of the icing research program conducted at the NACA
Lewis laboratory consisted of supplementing laboratory icing studies
with research flights in supercooled clouds. The meteorological
aspects of icing research included (1) development and testing of
instruments for measuring icing conditions during flight, (2) collection 
of data indicating the maximum extent, severity, and frequency of 
conditions for which thermal anti-icing systems should be
expected to provide protection, and (3) application of flight experience 
and meteorological data to the development of forecasting
techniques usable in flight planning and navigation to avoid potentially 
hazardous conditions.  </p>
<p>Sufficient in-flight measurements of icing conditions have been
made by the NACA and other organizations to provide tentative design
criterions for thermal anti-icing systems (reference 1). The meteorological 
data accumulated by the Lewis laboratory during the
1946-47 and the 1947-48 winter seasons are presented in references 2
and 3, respectively. Additional data are desirable to assure the
adequacy and statistical reliability of previous information, and,
if necessary, to revise or to extend proposed design conditions.
The observations made during the 1948-49 and the 1949-50 winters 
are presented herein. In addition, data gathered during four
winters of icing research flights are presented that indicate the
vertical and horizontal extent of supercooled. stratiform clouds
encountered and their location in relation to existing synoptic
weather conditions.  </p>

<h2>APPARATUS AND METHOD</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The airplanes used for research flights In icing conditions
were bomber-type aircraft equipped with thermal anti-icing systems.
Icing instruments Installed on the airplanes for the 1948-49 winter
were similar to those described in reference 3. The following
Instruments, designed to provide Improved and more complete measurements 
of meteorological data, were used. during the 1949-50 winter:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rotating multicylinders consisting of five cylinders each
2 inches in length with diameters of 1/8, 1/2, 1, 3, and 4 inches
with integral flanges and transition segments designed to reduce end
effects and to provide two-dimensional flow around the cylinders  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impingement recorder consisting of a 6-inch-diameter cylinder 
around which a movable water-sensitive tape was exposed for
2 to 6 seconds; the maximum-effective droplet diameter was calculated 
from the observed extent of impingement  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud detector consisting of an electrically heated metallic
probe for indicating presence of liquid water by measuring and recording 
temperature fluctuations caused by evaporation of impinging
water  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three rotating-disk icing-rate meters installed for comparison and developmental tests  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shielded thermocouples for continuous recording of free-air temperature  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The continuously recording icing-rate meters were calibrated
against the multicylinders and provided data concerning short duration 
or nearly instantaneous liquid-water concentrations encountered
in supercooled. cloud formations. Maximum values obtained with the
icing-rate meter are used. In this report to supplement the measurements 
of icing intensity obtained over greater horizontal distances
with the multicylinders.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Cumulative-frequency curves of the 136 observations of liquid-water 
content and mean-effective droplet diameter measured in
22 flights conducted during the 1948-49 and the 1949-50 winters are
presented in figure 1. The liquid-water content data indicate that
50 percent of the multicylinder observations were in clouds with
water concentrations in excess of 0.30 gram per cubic meter, whereas
10 percent of the observations indicated values higher than 0.54 grain
per cubic meter. The extreme value of 1.30 grams per cubic meter
(flight 11) was measured over a 5-minute exposure period of the 
multicylinders during straight-line flight.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Cumulative frequency curves of 136 multicylinder observations
of liquid-water content and mean-effective diameter measured in 
supercooled stratiform clouds during 22 icing flights.
" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2306%2FFigure%201.png">  </p>
<p>Of 74 flights conducted during the four winters for which in-
flight data are available, 57 flights encountered a trace or more
of ice. Multicylinder measurements of liquid-water concentrations
obtained during each of the flights were averaged and plotted against
the maximum distance flown in any one direction in icing, as shown in
figure 2. In order to provide additional data in the higher ranges
of liquid-water content, the distance traversed on a single heading
during one multicylinder exposure was used as the extent of measured
liquid-water concentrations in excess of 0.50 gram per cubic meter.
Such data are only approximate because the icing severity during
the interval between consecutive multicylinder observations was
indeterminant except during flights when icing-rate-meter data were
available. Extreme values of liquid-water content, obtainable from
continuous icing-rate-meter records, were used to provide additional
information on the extent of instantaneous or short-duration liquid-water 
concentrations. In most instances, the data in figure 2
approximate the maximum geographical extent of the continuous icing 
clouds. Comparison of these data with those measured over the western 
sections of the United States reported in reference 4 indicates
substantial agreement throughout the range of maximum values encountered 
irrespective of the diverse geographical areas and predominantly
different cloud types explored.  </p>
<p>Inspection of figure 2 indicates that liquid-water concentrations 
as high as 1.30 grams per cubic meter existed over a horizontal 
distance of 15 miles, 0.70 gram per cubic meter for a distance of 
approximately 100 miles, and a maximum average concentration of 
0.30 gram per cubic meter over a distance of nearly 200 miles.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vertical extent of stratiform icing clouds. -   </p>
<p>The depth of continuous icing clouds is a factor to be considered in 
flight navigation to reduce the rate of ice accretion, particularly with 
unprotected aircraft. In order to provide information on the average
and the maximum vertical extent of continuous or nearly continuous
icing conditions, data were obtained when feasible either by
surveying the clouds or by noting the height of the cloud tops
in relation to the height of the cloud bases reported by weather
observing stations over the flight area. Reliable data were
obtained for a total of 48 flights during four winters of icing
flights. The observations were generally obtained over terrain
where orographic effects were considered negligible. The maximum
depth of the icing clouds was not determined as the thickness of
one particular icing cloud layer in every case. Two or more cloud
layers sufficiently close together, or with varying bases and tops
such that icing conditions were unavoidable without frequent changes
in flight altitude, were considered as one cloud layer. The maximum
vertical extent of multiple cloud layers was approximately 6500 feet
as indicated in figure 3. Eighty percent of the icing conditions
was less than 4000 feet in vertical extent. The average observed
vertical extent of stratiform icing clouds was approximately
3000 feet. Flight surveys indicated a maximum depth of 3500 feet.
for any single cloud layer, which is in approximate agreement with
the discussion of cloud-thickness values presented in reference 2.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>The following results were obtained from data taken during
74 flights in search of icing conditions over the northern regions
of the United States east of the Rocky Mountain area with measurements 
in the Great Lakes area predominating:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Observations of liquid-water concentrations and mean-effective
droplet sizes obtained during flight in stratiform clouds at altitudes
below 10,000 feet during the 1948-49 and 1949-50 winters were in substantial 
agreement with values previously reported. Some slight differences 
existed, which were attributed to measuring techniques and
emphasis upon obtaining data in more severe conditions.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison of average liquid-water contents with horizontal
extent of the icing clouds indicated that values up to approximately
1.30 grams per cubic meter existed over a distance of 15 miles,
0.70 gram per cubic meter for a distance of 100 miles, and a maximum 
average liquid-water content of 0.30 gram per cubic meter over
a distance of approximately 200 miles.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum vertical depth of multiple layer supercooled
stratiform clouds observed in flight predominantly over level terrain
was approximately 6500 feet, whereas 80 percent of the icing conditions 
was less than 4000 feet in vertical extent. The average thickness 
of supercooled cloud layers so far observed is about 3000 feet.
The maximum observed thickness of any one cloud layer was 3500 feet
and is in approximate agreement with observations over other geographical 
areas of the United States.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In stratiform clouds existing at subfreezing temperatures
below 10,000 feet, icing conditions could be expected if no precipitation 
were reported by ground observing stations over the
cloud area. Conversely, continuous icing rarely occurred when most
observing stations over the area were reporting measurable precipitation 
(except in the case of freezing rain).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In low-level clouds, the most probable icing area associated
with an extratropical cyclonic disturbance was located in the northwest 
and the southwest quadrants of the low-pressure area. Icing
conditions occasionally existed in clouds below 10,000 feet near
the periphery of precipitation areas.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average liquid-water content as measured by multicylinders
did not exceed two-thirds of the theoretical maximum values.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum values of icing severity measured with the rotating-disk 
icing-rate meter indicated that localized regions might accumulate 
liquid-water concentrations equal to or in excess of the
adiabatic amounts.  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 7 from Masters plots a duration (nmi) effect on LWC. 
However, the unconventional plot obscures the peak LWC values for durations other than 6 nmi
(the end points are visible), 
so it is difficult to compare to NACA-TN-2306 Figure 2 above.  </p>
