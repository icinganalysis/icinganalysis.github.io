<h1>"A Review of Instruments Developed for the Measurement of the Meteorological Factors Conducive to Aircraft Icing"</h1>
<p><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The multicylinder is the "standard against which other instruments are calibrated"</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Nine instruments, including the fixed cylinder and rotating mulitcylinder, are qualitatively assessed.  </li>
<li>"The [multicylinder] method has assumed the position of a standard against which other instruments are calibrated, and is apt to remain so..."  </li>
<li>The effect of mass measurements errors on multicylinder results were assessed.  </li>
<li>"A reliable method for the measurement of drop-size distribution should be developed"  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The status of instrument suitable for the measurement of the 
meteorological factors conducive to aircraft icing is reviewed. The
meteorological factors to be evaluated are listed, and tentative 
values for the desired and acceptable accuracy of measurement for 
each factor are suggested.</p>
<p>Nine instruments which appear to be the most promising for the 
procurement of the meteorological data are discussed with respect to 
the quantities they measure, principle of operation, range and accu-
racy, duration of a single reading, and advantages and disadvantages 
associated with their use.  Recommendations are presented for the 
continued research and development of icing meteorological instruments. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Nine instruments were assessed:<br>
- Rotating Multicylinders<br>
- Fixed Cylinder<br>
- Rotating-Disk Icing-Rate Meter<br>
- Capillary Collector<br>
- Rainbow Recorder<br>
- Dew-Point Recorder<br>
- Visibility Meter<br>
- Sooted Slides<br>
- Drop Photography  </p>
<p>While photos of each instrument were included, the image quality of the pdf scan is poor, 
so I will not include them here.</p>
<p>While there is much of interest here, we focus on the cylinders.</p>
<p>Accuracy targets were determined:</p>
<p><img alt="Desired accuracy" src="images/naca-rm-a9c09/desired_accuracy.png">  </p>
<h3>Rotating Multicylinder</h3>
<p>Depending on the accuracy threshold desired, with the assumed mass measurement variations of 5%, 
the rotating multicylinder method may be applicable up to 
median effective drop diameters of 20 to 45 micrometers with the "A" set of cylinders:</p>
<p><img alt="Accuracy of measurements with cylinders" src="images/naca-rm-a9c09/cylinder_accuracy.png"></p>
<p>There were few details given on how these values were determined. 
Some inference was required to largely reproduce the values, see the file naca_rm_a9c09.py at <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> for details. 
In the figure below, it appears the the variance was over-estimated for larger drop size cases for cylinder set A. </p>
<p><img alt="Accuracy of measurements with cylinders" src="images/naca-rm-a9c09/naca_rm_a9c09_fig2_comparison.png"></p>
<p>Several advantages and disadvantages are listed for rotating multicylinders:</p>

<img alt="Multicylinder disadvantages" src="images/naca-rm-a9c09/cylinder_disadvantages.png"></p>
<p>Note the conclusion: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The [multicylinder] method has assumed the position of a standard against which other instruments are calibrated, and is apt to remain so...</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fixed Cylinder</h3>
<p>Several advantages and disadvantages are listed for the fixed cylinder:</p>
<p><img alt="Fixed cylinder" src="images/naca-rm-a9c09/fixed_cylinder_advantages.png"></p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>In the conclusions, several actions are recommended:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Development of the rotating disk should be continued. This
device should prove very useful in both the formative and statistical 
investigations just discussed, since it gives evidence of being 
capable of producing a continuous record of liquid-water content,
with small lag, practically independent of drop size.</li>
<li>The visibility meter should be investigated as a possible
statistical instrument for use with the rotating disk to provide
average drop-size information.</li>
<li>Development of the rainbow recorder as a potential single
instrument for providing both liquid-water content and drop-size
data should be continued.</li>
<li>A reliable method for the measurement of drop-size distribution 
should be developed.</li>
</ol>
