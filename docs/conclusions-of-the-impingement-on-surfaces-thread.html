<h1>The Use of Ko for Impingement Correlations</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of a modified water droplet inertia parameter Ko permits consolidation 
into only a few graphs of most of the published water drop trajectory
data. <sup id="fnref3:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="/impingement-on-airfoils.html">NACA-TN-3839</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, the studies in this Impingement on Surfaces thread 
"were a rather ad hoc collection of shapes and sizes". 
One unifying parameter emerged to correlate the results, 
the "Ko" modified water drop inertia parameter. </p>
<h3>"Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories" <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h3>
<p><a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">"Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories"</a> <sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> 
defined a term Ko (see the link for definitions of other terms):  </p>
<p><img alt="Equation 40. Ko for a cylinder. Ko - 1/8 = lambda/lambda_s * (K - 1/8) " src="/images%2FMathematical%20Investigation%20of%20Water%20Droplet%20Trajectories%2Fequation40.png">  </p>
<p>Ko is not given a name, it is only defined in relation to K:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quantity Κ that occurs in Eqs. (4) and (5) measures the inertia of the
droplet and varies in proportion to the density of the particle and increases
with its size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A correlation of Ko to Em for <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">cylinders</a> was provided (for a limited range of K values):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calculation of Em for low values of Κ<br>
Having found Ko by Eq. (40) and the data of Table I, we then calculate
Em by Eqn. (33) using Ko as the value of K. This method of calculation was
given as a semi empirical method in the report, "Super Cooled Water Droplets
in Rising Currents of Cold Saturated Air", Part I, page 275, by I. Langmuir,
sent to Materiel Command , Wright Field.
When the D. A. data were compared with the calculated values of Em, it
was found that the following small correction would bring the calculated
values into good agreement with the observed values, for all values of φ. The
correction was therefore included in the procedure for calculating Em.</p>
<p>For Κ in the range from 0.125 to 1.1;<br>

<h3>"Determination of drop trajectories by means of an extension of Stokes' Law" (1952) <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></h3>
<p>A version of Ko was generalized to apply to almost any surface. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Trajectory data were determined for drops in air flowing
over a cylinder, a sphere, a ribbon, and several airfoils, by reduction of the number of parameters previously used. One trajectory
data curve for each body was thus obtained where an entire family
of curves was previously necessary.<br>
This reduction of the number of parameters was suggested
by Langmuir.</p>
<p>Langmuir and Blodgett found that results obtained by the differential analyzer 
solution of (1) and (2) were in good agreement with values
resulting from calculations based on Ko', an adjusted value of K, and Stokes'
Law, where (for flow around a cylinders):</p>

<p><img alt="Equation 5." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FEquation%205.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>λ is the distance a droplet will travel if projected into still air with an
initial velocity of U when the drag coefficient follows values given in reference 1. <br>
λ/λs is obtained from:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Equation 6." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FEquation%206.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>λ/λs is therefore an average value of CDR/24 for a drop projected into still
air with an initial velocity U and final velocity zero. If, for the case of
still air, Eqs. (a) and (2) are solved by using an average value of CDR/24K, there
is a K for which we can apply Stokes' Law and obtain the same trajectory.
Ko is defined by:</p>

<p><img alt="Equation 7 and 8." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FEquation%207%20and%208.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this adjustment of K is extended to the case of a varying air velocity field, 
the curves of Figures 1-20 result.<br>
An examination of the curves suggests that for each body, instead
of a wide spread of curves as shown in the Guibert and Langmuir and Blodgett
reports, only one curve is then necessary.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we will look at the Em curves (only). There are also curves for βmax and impingement limits.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Cylinder Em vs. Ko." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FFigure%201.png">  </p>
<p>The values are similar for most values of Ko. 
However, for example at K=0.4, the spread in values (about 0.06 Em) are approaching the individual values
(0.13 to 0.19), indicating that a selected Ko correlation (not shown) would be less accurate at lower Ko values. </p>
<p>A later publication, "Ice Protection Investigation for Advanced Rotary-Wing Aircraft" <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, 
does show an example of a selected "mean line" Ko approximation.<br>
<img alt="Figure 83. Ko Approximation for Representing Em" src="/images%2FAD-771%20182%2FFigure%2083.png">  </p>
<p>Two of the airfoils from the review <a href="/impingement-on-airfoils.html">Impingement on Airfoils</a> were analysed:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. NACA 652-015 Airfoil Symmetrical 15% Thick, 4 degree angle of attack, Em vs. Ko." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7. Joukowski Airfoil Symmetrical 15% Thick, 4 degree angle of attack, Em vs. Ko." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FFigure%207.png">  </p>
<p>The Ko approximation works well for both of those airfoils.  </p>
<p>Remember the ribbon from <a href="/impingement-on-other-surfaces.html">Impingement on Other Surfaces (NACA-TN-3658)</a>?  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 20. Ribbon Em vs. Ko." src="/images%2FDetermination%20of%20drop%20trajectories%2FFigure%2020.png">  </p>
<p>Fortunately, most applications for a ribbon will be "thin", so that Ko is likely to be high, 
and the Ko approximation rather good.  </p>
<p>While "Determination of drop trajectories by means of an extension of Stokes' Law" 
was published in 1952, there was no mention of it or Ko in the 
<a href="/university-of-michigan-airplane-icing-information-course-1953.html">University of Michigan Airplane Icing Information Course</a> in 1953, 
where Tribus presented "A new method for calculating water-droplet trajectories about streamlined bodies" from 1951.   </p>
<h3>The Post NACA-era</h3>
<p><a href="/impingement-on-airfoils.html">NACA-TN-3839</a> used Ko to "correlate to the extent possible" experimental results for different airfoils.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12. Experimental total collection efficiency of six unswept airfoils at 0° angle of attack." src="/images%2Fnaca-tn-3839%2FFigure%2012.png">  </p>
<p>We see the same data replotted in <a href="/ads-4.html">ADS-4, “Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data”</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2-8. Collection efficiency versus Ko for airfoils - Experimental data at 0 angle of attack." src="/images%2Fads4%2FFigure%202-8.png">  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, ADS-4 does not cite "Determination of drop trajectories by means of an extension of Stokes' Law", 
nor any work by Tribus. 
It does cite the NACA publications noted above, 
and a publication that I have not been able to find <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.   </p>
<p>The same figure (renumbered) appears in the FAA Aircraft Icing Handbook <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Digital Computing</h3>
<p>As we saw in <a href="/methods-of-water-drop-impingement-quantification.html">Methods of Water Drop Impingement Quantification</a>, 
methods other than digital computers were used in the NACA-era.</p>
<p>By the close of the NACA-era, <a href="/design-manuals.html">Design Manuals</a> such as <a href="/ads-4.html">ADS-4</a> (1964) 
provided impingement plots Ko correlated impingement data. 
Solution by computers are mentioned, but no examples were given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The calculation of droplet trajectories can be extremely tedious and time consuming; 
however, the problem can be set up and solved using modern high-speed electronic computers.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/the-greatest-thing-that-you-have-probably-never-read-1969-aircraft-ice-protection-report-of-symposium-ramon-wilder.html">Wilder</a> <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> mentions the use of digital computers for impingement calculations in industry in 1969. </p>
<p>There are many currently available options for calculating impingement on a surface. 
LEWICE <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> is one example. 
For potential flow, the air flow field calculations are generally a small portion of the total run time 
for impingement calculations.
However, for viscid flow calculations, the air flow field calculations dominate the total run time required. </p>
<h3>Continuing uses of the Ko parameter</h3>
<p>The parameter Ko is still useful today for illustrating impingement trends. </p>
<p>Here are examples from the "Aircraft Icing Handbook" <sup id="fnref2:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For airfoils, Bragg (references 2-12, 2-33, and 2-34) has studied the effect of geometry on
droplet impingement. Several airfoil geometry terms were considered, including: maximum thickness
and its location, maximum camber and its location, and leading edge radius. One of the strongest
relationships found was that between the airfoil leading edge radius and the maximum impingement
efficiency.<br>
In figure 2-61, βmax is plotted versus leading edge radius for the thirty airfoils of
reference 2-33. (Points for four airfoils are indicated by solid symbols and labeled; see figure 2-60
for profiles.) Data are plotted for two angles of attack and three modified inertia parameters. Note
that at Ko = 0.01 (within the "typical" range for a wing section of a general aviation aircraft - see figure
2-4) there is a strong relationship between leading edge radius and βmax. For an airfoil with leading
edge radius of 0.8 percent chord and Ko = 0.01, βmax is approximately 0.5, but drops to around 0.25
for a leading edge radius of 2.0 percent chord. Also note that the dependence decreases markedly
with increasing Ko and that Smax decreases slightly with increasing angle of attack for each value of
Ko. Finally, note that variation in βmax for a particular value of the leading edge radius arises from
other characteristics of the airfoils, since they differ in more than leading edge radius.<br>
Another relationship is that between airfoil maximum thickness and collection efficiency, E. In
figure 2-62, E is plotted as a function of maximum thickness for all thirty airfoils and for four Ko's.
For all Ko's shown, E decreases as the airfoil thickness increases. However, the effect becomes less
pronounced with decreasing Ko and for Ko = 0.01 is quite slight (note also that E &lt; 0.10 for all airfoils
for this condition). Figure 2-62 indicates that thicker airfoils (and bodies in general) are less efficient
droplet collectors with respect to the width h of their projected frontal area. This does not mean,
however, that thicker airfoils accrete less mass of ice. Figure 2-63 shows ΔY0 as a function of airfoil
maximum thickness for the same conditions as figure 2-62. Here the opposite relationship is seen,
that is, ΔY0 increases as airfoil thickness increases, the effect being very pronounced for large Ko
(although non-existent for Ko = 0.01). Since E = -ΔY0/h, it follows that E decreases with increasing
airfoil thickness because h increases faster than ΔY0, but since mass of ice accreted is directly
proportional to ΔY0, it is essentially independent of airfoil thickness for Ko
increasing airfoil thickness for larger Ko.</p>

<p>I will emphasize: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This does not mean, however, that thicker airfoils accrete less mass of ice.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is corrects a mis-conception that I have heard more than once. 
E is a dimensionless water catch efficiency parameter. 
However, in most practical applications, one is concerned with the dimensional 
amount of water catch, and something like Figure 2-63 is useful to illustrated that. </p>
<p>Figure 81 from <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> provides another useful illustration.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total ordinate, "Y", divided
by the maximum airfoil thickness, "d", is called Em, the efficiency of
water catch. Figure 81 depicts the droplet trajectories around a 2-D
airfoil at an angle of attack α.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 81. Water Droplet Trajectories in an Airfoil Flow Field and Illustration of Impingement Terminology." src="/images%2FAD-771%20182%2FFigure%2081.png">  </p>
<p>The block labeled "WATER" is the amount of water that will strike the airfoil. 
A thinner airfoil might have a water catch efficiency near one, 
and the limiting trajectories would be nearly straight lines, 
but both airfoils would catch nearly the same amount of water. </p>
<p>(A small correction to Figure 81. Conventionally, Em is calculated with 
projected airfoil height at α, not the maximum airfoil thickness at α=0. 
However, this does not affect the point illustrated.)</p>
<p>Why is Em of such interest?</p>
<p>[Emphasis added.]  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presentation of Tribus' data using the Ko parameter showed the close grouping 
of data points instead of the usual family of curves. A mean line
through the Ko curves showed that the deviations in efficiency of water
catch and limits of ice impingement were generally about 10 percent or
less. (Exceptions were Em data for the cylinder and ribbon at low Ko
values for which the deviations from the mean line were higher than 10
percent.) 
<strong>This is accurate enough for most preliminary calculations involving the heat requirements for anti-icing an airfoil.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw previously in the <a href="/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html">Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread</a>, 
the <a href="NASA-CR-2004-212875.md">"Manual of Scaling Methods"</a> <sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> uses 
Ko correlations for a cylinder to approximately the impingement on an airfoil, particularly for βmax. 
This provides "an economical method for solving the basic water droplet trajectory" 
for a use where a lot of detail is not required. </p>
<h2>Citations</h2>
<p>"Determination of drop trajectories by means of an extension of Stokes' Law" had nine citations found at scholar.google.com.</p>
<p>I believe that as it was not cited in either ADS-4 or “Aircraft Icing Handbook", 
its contributions and importance are under-appreciated.  </p>
<p>This is an instance of the work of Tribus being under-appreciated. 
Another instance is the thermodynamics of ice formation. 
While Messinger clearly credited Tribus in 
<a href="/messinger.html">"Equilibrium Temperature of an Unheated Icing Surface as a Function of Airspeed"</a> <sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>
