<p>This describes the use of the rotating-disk-type icing-rate meter.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Flight icing-rate data obtained in a dense and abnormally deep
supercooled stratiform cloud system indicated the existence of
liquid-water contents generally exceeding values in amount and extent
previously reported over the midwestern sections of the United States.
Additional information obtained during descent through a part of the
cloud system indicated liquid-water contents that significantly
exceeded theoretical values, especially near the middle of the cloud
layer. The growth of cloud droplets to sizes that resulted in
sedimentation from the upper portions of the cloud is considered to be a
possible cause of the high water contents near the center of the cloud
layer. Flight measurements of the vertical temperature distribution
in the cloud layer indicated a rate of change of temperature with
altitude exceeding that of the moist adiabatic lapse rate. This excessive
rate of change is considered to have contributed to the severity of
the condition.  </p>
<p>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE  </p>
<p>The meteorological instrumentation on the research aircraft permitted
continuous measurements of liquid-water content during flight
and, in addition, made available data concerning the vertical variation
of liquid-water content through a dense region of the stratiform cloud layer.<br>
These data were obtained with a rotating-disk-type icing-rate meter
calibrated to measure liquid-water content of icing clouds. This
instrument was first developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(reference 1) and consisted essentially of a rotating disk edge-wise to the
air stream, a feeler for measuring the thickness of ice
collected on the edge, and a scraper for removing the ice after it had
been measured. A photograph of the instrument in operation is given
in figure 1(a). The complete instrument is shown in figure 1(b) mounted
on the left side of the fuselage of the research aircraft used in this
investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Icing data collected on routine operations by four DC-4-type aircraft
equipped with NACA pressure-type icing-rate meters are presented
as preliminary information obtained from a statistical icing data program
sponsored by the NACA with the cooperation of many airline companies
and the United States Air Force. The program is continuing on a much
greater scale to provide large quantities of data from many air routes
in the United States and overseas. Areas not covered by established air
routes are also being included in the survey.  </p>
<p>The four aircraft which collected the data presented in this report
were operated by United Air Lines over a transcontinental route from
January through May, 1951. An analysis of the pressure-type icing-rate
meter was satisfactory for collecting statistical data during routine
operations. Data obtained on routine flight icing encounters from these
four instrumented aircraft, although insufficient for a conclusive
statistical analysis, provide a greater quantity and considerably more
realistic information than that obtained from random research flights.
A summary of statistical data will be published when the information
obtained daring the 1951-52 icing season and that to be obtained during
the 1952-53 season can be analyzed and assembled. The 1951-52 data
already analyzed indicate that the quantity, quality, and range of
icing information being provided by this expanded program should afford
a sound basis for ice-protection-system design by defining the important
meteorological parameters of the icing cloud.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The meteorological phase of the icing research program conducted
by the NACA has been previously confined to research flights into icing
conditions. These in-flight measurements of the meteorological quantities 
associated with aircraft icing (summarized in reference 1) have
been limited to a relatively small number of flights over confined sections 
of the country and have thus provided only tentative design
criteria for ice-protection systems.  </p>
<p>The majority of the research flights into icing conditions were
made by attempting to select weather conditions, flight paths, and altitudes, 
which would yield heavy or continuous icing. Multiple traverses
were often made when such conditions were found. It is impossible,
therefore, to determine from this information the extent or frequency
of specified icing conditions that would be encountered during normal
flight operations such as those experienced by airlines on routine
schedules. Additional data are needed to substantiate or to modify the
ice-protection-system design conditions in order that all-weather protective 
designs can be accomplished with the lowest possible penalties
in terms of performance and payload. Statistical icing data obtained
from routine operations could serve both as a basis for optimum design
of ice-protection systems and as an aid to the operator in prescribing
flight-control procedures, such as preferred altitudes, which would
avoid or minimize hazardous icing conditions.  </p>
<p>With the realization of this need for additional information, the
NACA Lewis laboratory has initiated a program in cooperation with the
major airlines and the United States Air Force to obtain measured icing
data encountered during routine operations. These data include measurements 
of icing rate, liquid-water content computed from icing rate and
airspeed, temperature, duration of icing, observations of the geographic
location, type of ice, and effect of icing on the aircraft</p>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A statistical survey and a preliminary analysis are made of icing
data collected from scheduled flights over the United States and Canada

pressure-type icing-rate meters. This interim report presents information

<p>An analysis of over 600 icing encounters logged by three airlines

provided relative frequencies of many icing-cloud variables,
such as horizontal extent, vertical thickness, temperatures, icing
rate, liquid-water content, and total ice accumulation.<br>
Liquid-water contents were higher than data from earlier research
flights in layer-type clouds but slightly lower than previous data from
cumulus clouds. Broken-cloud conditions, indicated by intermittent icing,
accounted for nearly one-half of all the icing encounters. About 90 percent
of the encounters did not exceed a distance of 120 miles, and continuous
icing did not exceed 50 miles for 90 percent of the unbroken
conditions. Icing cloud thicknesses measured during climbs and descents
were less than 4500 feet for 90 percent of the vertical cloud traverses.</p>

SUMMARY OF RESULTS  
This report summarizes the statistical icing data collected from
scheduled airline flights over United States and Canadian air routes from
November 1951 to June 1952. The following significant information was
provided:  
(1) Almost one-half of over 600 separate icing encounters logged by
the airline aircraft were intermittent icing conditions where several
nonicing periods during an encounter indicated broken-cloud conditions.  
(2) About 10 percent of the encounters exceeded 120 miles in horizontal 
extent, with one encounter reaching a distance of 430 miles. Distances 
in which icing was continuous, however, did not exceed 124 miles,
and 90 percent of these unbroken conditions extended less than 50 miles.
These measurements were influenced by the distance between scheduled stops
and by other flight procedures which varied among the airlines collecting
data.  
(3) The vertical extent of icing-cloud layers measured during routine
climbs and descents gave maximum cloud thicknesses of 10,800 feet for
multiple layers and 5500 feet for single layers. About 90 percent of all
the vertical cloud traverses were less than 4500 feet.  
(4) Almost 90 percent of the temperatures observed in icing were
above -15° C (+5° F), and the lowest temperature observed was -27° C
(-17° F).  
(5) Liquid-water contents computed from icing-rate measurements
exceeded 1.0 gram per cubic meter for 7 minutes out of every 100 minutes
in icing conditions. The total frequency distribution of water contents
at all temperatures was obtained by extrapolation of the data into the
unreliable range of the icing-rate meter. These data are lower than
previously published information obtained in cumulus clouds but considerably 
higher than earlier data taken in layer-type clouds. For horizontal
distances exceeding 160 miles, liquid-water contents averaged 0.3 gram
per cubic meter or less.  
(6) Total ice accumulation, defined as the thickness 
of ice calculated to collect on the ice-sensing probe if
continuous icing was permitted, was computed to be 2 inches or less for
93 percent of the encounters. The maximum accumulation was 6 inches of
ice calculated for two encounters extending about 150 miles.

frequencies of flight in clouds and cloud temperatures.  </p>
<p>The results show that aircraft operators can expect icing probabilities
to vary widely throughout the year from near zero in the cold Arctic
areas in winter up to 7 percent in areas where greater cloudiness and

cloudy conditions.</p>

CONCLUDING REMARKS  
The data included in this report are restricted to specific flight
levels and selected areas of the oceans. Further application of these
results to the operational analysis of specific missions or to the 
formulation of ice-protection design requirements would require a method
for extending the results to apply to ocean areas in general. No direct
and simple correlations were immediately evident between the icing
probabilities and the many variables existing in the over-all data of
this report. The effects of altitude, geographical location, and climatic 
factors such as seasonal variations in cloudiness and temperature
are all interrelated in such a way that classification of the data in
terms of one variable is influenced by the correlated variations in
other variables.  
A preliminary study indicated that a limited extension of the icing
probabilities to other ocean areas may be possible if based on known
climatology of the areas involved. However, further analysis, beyond
the scope of this report, will be required.  
In general, icing statistics obtained from flight data are strongly
influenced by the flight procedures dictated by a particular mission and
by pilot practices used in the operation of the aircraft. In airline
operation or on certain Air Force missions, any meteorological conditions
considered hazardous or of adverse effect on flight progress are avoided,
if possible, by allowable changes in schedule, course, or altitude, therefore, 
these conditions are not completely experienced, and data from
such operations, if used, would produce a statistical bias. The results
presented in this report are essentially unbiased in this respect, since
the missions were flown primarily to determine weather factors and were
not altered from routine procedures to avoid adverse conditions unless
necessary for the safety of the flight. As compared with airline experience, 
the high icing probabilities (up to 7 percent) recorded for some
areas during certain seasons are a result of combining a greater existence
of icing conditions in those areas with unbiased statistics from the
flight operations that supplied the data.  
The significant results pointed out in this study are the large
variation of icing probabilities (0 to 0.07) that was shown to exist over
ocean areas throughout the year. Also, the general tendency of colder
cloud temperatures to reduce the probability of icing in equally cloudy
conditions is of interest, since this establishes over-all values for a
relation known to exist through previous experience and research.

<h2>NACA-TN-4314 "Icing Frequencies Experienced During Climb and Descent by Fighter-Interceptor Aircraft", 1958 <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></h2>
<p>The data from this are included in the later NASA Memo 1-19-59E. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Data and analyses are presented on the relative frequencies of
occurrence and severity of icing cloud layers encountered by jet aircraft
in the climb and descent phases of flights to high altitudes. Fighter-interceptor
aircraft operated by the Air Defense Command (USAF) at bases
in the Duluth and Seattle areas collected the data with icing meters
installed for a 1-year period. The project was part of an extensive
program conducted by the NACA to collect Icing cloud data for evaluating
the icing problem relevant to routine operations.  </p>
<p>The average frequency of occurrence of icing was found to be about
5 percent of the number of climbs and descents during 1 year of operations
The icing encounters were predominantly in the low and middle
cloud layers, decreasing above 15,000 feet to practically none above
25,000 feet.  </p>
<p>The greatest thickness of ice that would accumulate on any aircraft
component (as indicated by the accretion on a small object) was measured
with the icing meters. The ice thicknesses on a small sensing probe
averaged less than 1/32 inch and did not exceed 1/2 inch. Such accumulations
are relatively small when compared with those that can form during
horizontal flight in icing clouds. The light accretions resulted from
relatively steep angles of flight through generally thin cloud layers.<br>
Because of the limited statistical reliability of the results,
an analysis was made using previous statistics on icing clouds below an
altitude of 20,000 feet to determine the general icing severity probabilities.
The calculations were made using adiabatic lifting as a basis
to establish the liquid-water content. Probabilities of over-all ice
accretions on a small object as a function of airspeed and rate of climb
were computed from the derived water contents. These results were then
combined with the probability of occurrence of icing in order to give
the icing severity that can be expected for routine aircraft operations.</p>

INTRODUCTION  
Routine flying at high altitudes (above 20,000 ft) has proven that
adverse weather conditions, including icing, are generally not as severe
as those experienced at lower levels. However, the extent to which icing
protection can be reduced or eliminated for high-altitude aircraft may
depend on conditions encountered during phases of flight other than those
at high-altitude cruise. The icing problem for high-altitude aircraft
can be considered in three phases: icing encountered during cruise at
high altitudes, icing encountered during climb and descent, and icing
encountered during approach. In this report only the climb and descent
phase of the problem is studied with the knowledge that these parts of
the flight are subject to the greater frequency and intensity of icing
clouds that exist below an altitude of 20,000 feet. Measurements of
supercooled clouds at these lower levels have been conducted by the NACA
(ref. 1) and others concerned with the icing problem. The extent to
which these conditions are a problem for high-altitude aircraft are evaluated 
in this report for routine flight operations.

<!--
CONCLUDING REMARKS  
The icing frequencies reported from the two surveyed areas can be
used only as a very rough estimate of the probabilities of occurrence
of icing for other locations and periods. Because of the small number
of encounters, the limited period of the survey, and the sampling from
only two areas, the statistical reliability of the reported frequencies
is rather poor. In general, a method of estimating the probability of
encountering icing for other areas would require known frequencies of
cloud penetrations and conditional probabilities that icing existed in
these clouds. Penetration frequencies would relate to the normal frequencies 
of cloud cover in a given area provided the flight path was not
purposely altered to avoid clouds. The probability of icing when penetrating 
clouds at temperatures below freezing generally can be related
to the cloud temperature, with colder cloudE tending to reduce the
probability of icing.  
Icing clouds encountered during low-level approach procedures at the
terminal phase of the flight should be considered apart from the over-all
climb and descent icing problem. Depending on navigation and air traffic
considerations (e.g., holding), the approach may require a flight path in
icing clouds covering a relatively longer distance than that when
traveling at an angle through a cloud layer. This would produce ice 
accretions larger than those collected during climb or descent. However,
from a probability viewpoint these large accretions are less likely to
occur. In climb or descent, cloud layers existing at any level in the
vertical traverse will be penetrated, whereas in the low-level approach
only cloud layers existing at the altitude of the approach will be encountered. 
The probability of encountering icing of given severity is,
therefore, dependent upon the probability of the occurrence of a cloud
layer of given depth, reduced by the additional probability of that cloud
layer existing at a given distance above the ground. In the Duluth area,
for example, the cloud bases (ceilings) reported as being below 5000
feet are such that the frequency of icing encounters within that altitude
range would be only about one-seventh of the over-all frequency of icing
encountered during climb and descent. The severity of the problem can
be further reduced if provision is made for small changes in holding
altitude to keep the flight above or below a cloud layer.  
The results of this investigation show that the greater frequency
of icing existing at lower levels is encountered by high-altitude aircraft 
during climb and descent. However, the icing severity in terms of
the amount of ice accumulated will be relatively light because of the
short distance flown within the cloud layers. Icing severity can become
a problem when the flight plan requires longer distances within icing
clouds or requires the unavoidable penetration of cumulonimbus clouds
containing very high water contents.

<h2>NASA Memo 1-19-59E "Summary of Statistical Icing Cloud Data Measured Over United States and North Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Ocean During Routine Aircraft Operations", 1959 <sup id="fnref2:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>An extensive program was conducted to obtain icing-cloud statistics
needed in aircraft design and operation. The data were collected during
routine flights of airline end United States Air Force aircraft.
Pressure-sensitive icing meters were installed on 72 service aircraft
flown by several different cooperating organizations along domestic and
overseas airways and over wilde areas of the Pacific and Arctic oceans.  </p>
<p>The results of this survey are summarized in tabular form and as
frequency distributions of the measured icing-cloud parameters.
Distributions are given for cloud liquid-water content, distance traveled in
icing, depth of an icing-cloud layer, temperature of icing clouds, and
a reference measure of the total ice accretion (thickness) resulting
from over-all exposure to the cloud system.  </p>
<p>Data were received from 3200 icing-cloud encounters recorded over
several icing seasons. Statistical presentation of these data required
defining a unit of cloud system length, particularly for conditions of
intermittent icing produced by broken clouds. A unit dicing encounter,
frequently containing several separate periods of icing, was established
when a period of no lce accretion exceeded 10 minutes. The distance
traveled within icing clouds, when accumulated for an encounter, exceeded
56 miles in 10 percent of the encounters. The distribution of liquid-water
content, averaged over short distances (1-min intervals of flight),
showed a mean of 0.25 gram per cubic meter with values under 0.6 gram
per cubic meter existing 90 percent of the time. These cloud water contents
were about two-thirds of those calculated from adiabatic lifting
theory using the measured cloud depths and temperature data. The distribution
of icing temperatures showed that clouds colder than -20° C existed in
10 percent of the encounters.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>Air Routes and Areas Covered in Survey  </p>
<p>The approximate location of the air routes and areas over which the
icing-cloud data were collected are indicated on a northern hemisphere
map in figure 5. Data from United States and overseas airways were received
mostly from the airline companies that participated. Icing encountered
over ocean areas was reported from weather reconnaissance
flights made by the U. S. Air Force squadrons operated by the Air Weather
Service. These flights were conducted daily along prescribed tracks
ranging up to 2400 miles in length. Table I lists the separate alr
routes and areas, the corresponding organizations that contributed data,
and the types of aircraft that were instrumented. A total of 72 icing-meter
installations were proportioned among the various organizations to
obtain as complete a coverage as possible.  </p>

<p>The distribution of 1-minute average water concentrations is also
plotted in cumulative form in figure 7. In this type of graph a particular
value of a given variable is plotted against the fraction of the
total number of measurements in which this value is exceeded. This fraction
represents the frequency in which a specified value is exceeded and
can be interpreted as the probability of encountering values greater than
that amount. In this manner the probability of the higher water contents
can be better estimated. A straight-line relation on a semilog grid was
drawn through the data points. The meter readings that fall above the
line in the region between 0.4 and 0.7 gram per cubic meter and those
that fall below the line beyond 0.7 gram per cubic meter can be interpreted
as resulting from the operating characteristics of the sensing
probe, as discussed in appendix B. The relation of this probability distribution
to a calculated value shown as a dashed line is discussed in a
following section. The measured probabilities indicate that water concentrations
averaged over 1-minute intervals would be experienced approximately as follows:<br>
(1) 0.3 Gram per cubic meter exceeded in approximately 33 percent of the intervals<br>
(2) 0.6 Gram per cubic meter exceeded in 10 percent of the intervals<br>
(3) 1.1 Grams per cubic meter exceeded in 1 percent of the intervals  </p>
<p>These results are lower than preliminary values published in an interim
report (ref. 3). The data presently reported are considered more reliable
because they are based on a larger sampling of data, and on improved
installation and operation of the icing meter. A comparison of the data
from this program with values from multicylinder measurements taken earlier 
(ref. 1) shows that higher water contents (&gt;0.5 g/cu m) averaged
over short distances exist somewhat more frequently then was previously
indicated.  </p>

<p>APPENDIX B  </p>
<p>CALIBRATION OF ICING METERS  </p>
<p>The operation of the icing meter was most seriously effected when
a so-called runoff condition occurred. This condition, which affects
all ice-collecting instruments, is defined as a surface effect where the
impinging water fails to freeze immediately because the surface temperature
has been elevated to the freezing point by the latent heat of fusion.
The extent to which this occurs depends on the heat balance on the
surface, which is a function primarily of the impingement rate, droplet
size, air temperature, airspeed, and altitude. If these conditions are
such that the surface temperature remains below freezing, the ice continues
to build up. When the surface approaches the freezing point,
however, less ice will form and the excess water runs along the surface
and may freeze back of the leading edge or may blow off. The icing-meter
probe is especially sensitive to this condition in that the liquid
water on the surface acts to plug the holes with a smaller than normal
ice thickness and in an erratic fashion. This situation is illustrated
in figure 12 where a given icing rate is maintained while the air temperature
is brought up toward the freezing point. The ratio of the indicated
icing rate to an icing rate corresponding to the water impingement rate
is plotted against air temperature. The indicated rate is a calculated
value assuming a constant ice thickness for the indicated icing times.</p>
<p>The data points of figure 12 show that during runoff this rate can approach
values 50 percent higher than the icing rate prior to runoff.
The readings are erratic, which makes any correction factors difficult
to determine. As the temperature nears the freezing point the indicated
accretion rate becomes less than the original rate. In this condition
very little ice forms, and most of the impinging water runs around the
tube and blows off. Thus, an increased icing time is required to obtain
a fixed Ap giving a lower indicated icing rate. The interrelation of
air temperature, icing rate, and airspeed, which initiates the runoff
condition on the sensing probe, is shown in figure 13. These relations
were determined from the icing research tunnel studies and were used to
establish regions of reliable operation for the icing meters.</p>

<p>In order to evaluate these assumptions, calculated water contents
from the icing rate indications were compared with two other methods of
measuring water content, rotating multicylinders (described in ref. 6)
and an aeroscope {described in ref. 7). The multicylinder method is
based on the principle that cylinders of different sizes collect different
quantities of lce per unit frontal area, whereas the aeroscope collects
and measures the individual cloud droplets though an oil medium
and photographic technique. For the comparison studies these units were
mounted in the proximity of two ice-sensing probes in an aircraft installation.</p>
<p>Simultaneous exposures to natural icing clouds were made
with all instruments. The results are shown in figure 14 as separate
comparisons of the icing meters with each method. Each data point in
the figure represents a reading of water content indicated by each instrument
averaged over the exposure distance of a multicylinder sample
(4 to 14 miles). The points scatter about the lines for a ratio of 1 in
both comparisons. The icing-meter readings averaged slightly greater
than those of the multicylinders (mean line 0.01 g/cu m below the ratio
line of 1) with an average deviation from the mean of 0.03 gram per cubic
meter. Somewhat less agreement was found between the icing meters and
the aeroscope with the meter readings averaging slightly less than those
of the aeroscope (mean line 0.03 g/cu m above the ratio line of 1) and
with an average deviation from the mean of 0.05 gram per cubic meter.
The accuracy of water contents calculated from the icing meter indications
cannot be easily evaluated from these comparisons, since the measurement
errors in the other methods are not well established. These
studies show that reasonably good agreement exists between icing-meter
indications and those of two other methods of measuring water content
in icing clouds.</p>

<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>An extensive program of collecting icing-cloud data with instrumented
airline and U. S. Air Force aircraft during routine flights has provided
the following results:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Icing-cloud systems contained voids of varying length which resulted 
in separated periods of continuous ice buildup within a given
system. For convenience, voids in the clouds exceeding 10 minutes of
flight were not measured. This limitation defined a unit of cloud-system 
length called an icing encounter. Statistical values of many of
the icing parameters were based on measurements taken within this unit
of icing-cloud length.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A total of 3200 icing encounters were recorded by the cooperative 
organizations along airways within the United States, across the
North Atlantic, along the Pacific air route to Alaska and Japan, and
over wide arcas of the Pacific and Arctic oceans.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following statistics were derived from frequency distributions 
of the measured icing parameters:<br>
(a) Liquid-water content (averaged over 1-minute intervals of ice buildup):<br>
(1) 0.3 Gram per cubic meter exceeded in approximately 33 percent of intervals<br>
(2) 0.6 Gram per cubic meter exceeded in 10 percent of intervals<br>
(3) 1.1 Grams per cubic meter exceeded in 1 percent of intervals<br>
(b) Distance traveled within icing clouds (cumulative distance in icing throughout an encounter):<br>
(1) 26 Miles exceeded in approximately 33 percent of icing encounters<br>
(2) 53 Miles exceeded in 10 percent of icing encounters<br>
(3) 120 Miles exceeded in 1 percent of icing encounters<br>
(c) Depth of an icing-cloud layer:<br>
(1) 1500 Feet exceeded in approximately 33 percent of icing-cloud layers<br>
(2) 2700 Feet exceeded in 10 percent of icing-cloud layers<br>
(3) 4700 Feet exceeded in 1 percent of icing-cloud layers<br>
(d) Reference ice accretion (cumulative ice thickness on ice-sensing probe following icing encounter):<br>
(1) 0.35 Inch exceeded in approximately 33 percent of icing encounters<br>
(2) 0.85 Inch exceeded in 10 percent of icing encounters<br>
(3) 2.3 Inches exceeded in 1 percent of icing encounters<br>
(e) Temperature within icing clouds:<br>
(1) Colder than -12° C in approximately 33 percent of icing encounters<br>
(2) Colder than -20° C in 10 percent of icing encounters<br>
(3) Colder than -32° C in 1 percent of icing encounters  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frequency distribution of liquid-water content showed a mean
of 0.25 gram per cubic meter and a mode of 0.15 gram per cubic meter.
The water contents of this distribution were about two-thirds of those
derived from a distribution calculated from adiabatic lifting theory and
a statistical procedure using the measured cloud-depth and temperature
distributions.  </p>
