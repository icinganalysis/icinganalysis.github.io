<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating becomes common for ice protection in the jet era.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>To support jet engine powered transportation, NACA had several studies of ice protection using compressed air heating.  </li>
<li>Deicing schemes were proposed to reduce the amount of air bled from the engines.  </li>
<li>Some innovative features, like continuously heated parting strips and 
recirculating hot air supply, did not see much use.  </li>
<li>Compressed air heating is used widely today for jet powered transports.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As aviation entered the jet propulsion age, 
reciprocating-engine exhaust heat was not an option. 
However, the jet engine air compressor offers an ample 
(but not unlimited) supply of hot, compressed air that may be bled 
from the engine compressor airstream 
for ice protection, cabin heating, and other functions. </p>
<p>Several NACA studies considered using compressed air heating in a 
deicing mode, rather than anti-icing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION
The protection of wings and tail surfaces for high-speed, high-altitude 
turbojet-powered aircraft by local heating of the areas subject
to icing may be accomplished by either continuous heating, or cyclical
de-icing. In continuous heating, the surfaces are either raised to a
temperature just sufficient to maintain the impinging water in a liquid
state or are supplied sufficient heat to evaporate all the impinging
water in a specified distance behind the impingement area. Past NACA
research has provided basic criteria for use in the design of continuous
heating systems (references 1 and 2); however, the exact type of continuous 
heating for an airplane component depends on a complexity of
parameters and is more fully discussed in reference 3. Design analysis
in reference 3 has shown that the heat requirements and associated airplane 
performance penalties for high-speed, high-altitude transport
aircraft using continuous heating for icing protection are extremely
large and in some cases may be prohibitive.  </p>

</ul>
<p>I have not been able to find a copy of this. 
However, NACA-TN-2866 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> has a similar title and shares three of the authors, 
so I believe that it has similar information. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another method by which icing protection for airfoil shapes can be
accomplished is by cyclical de-icing in which some ice is permitted to
form on the surfaces and then is removed periodically during short,
intensive applications of heat. A water film between the surface and
the ice is caused by the heat application and permits removal of the
ice by aerodynamic forces. Because the heating is intermittent, heat is
supplied successively to relatively small surface areas; a constant heat
load is thus maintained on a heat source. The total heat input for
cyclical de-icing, therefore, can be greatly reduced from that required
for continuous heating.  </p>
<p>Because ice formations normally extend over the leading edge and
onto both upper and lower surfaces, removal by aerodynamic forces is
slow and erratic even though sufficient heat has been applied to form a
water film beneath the ice. The need for a continuously heated parting
strip near the leading edge of airfoils is indicated in reference 4 and
unpublished NACA data. When an ice-free strip is maintained spanwise
along the leading edge, the ice formation is divided into two segments,
one each on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil, and removal by
aerodynamic forces is facilitated.  </p>
<p>DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR HOT-GAS CYCLICAL DE-ICING SYSTEM<br>
Analysis of the problems associated with the design of a hot-gas
cyclical de-icing system for airfoils indicates that the following
criteria should be considered:<br>
1. The surface area to be de-iced should be divided into a number
of segments such that the total number of segments heated in sequence
will equal the cycle ratio (total cycle time divided by heat-on period).
In this manner, a constant heat load will be maintained.
2. The gas supply duct should be maintained at an elevated tempera-
ture level to avoid undue thermal lag in the system.
3. A continuously heated parting strip should be provided near the
leading edge in order to obtain consistent and rapid ice removal during
cyclical de-icing.
4. In order to insure good ice removal and prevent ice-bridging
between the various intermittently heated segments, chordwise parting
strips may be desirable.
5. Insulation for the gas supply system may be desirable to reduce
heat losses.  </p>
<p>A unique solution to the preceding criteria is obtained by the hot-
gas cyclical de-icing system shown in figure 1. The system consists of
the following principal features:<br>
1. The gas supply system consists of a doub1e-passage duct in which
high-temperature, high-pressure gas will flow outboard in a forward
passage and return in a contiguous rearward passage. Throttling valves
are located in the rearward passage at each of the airfoil segments to
be intermittently heated. These valves are opened in spanwise sequence
and thereby permit a constant flow of gas through the forward passage.
The constant flow maintains the entire duct continuously heated; consequently, 
thermal lags in the system become negligible.<br>
2. An ice-free spanwise parting strip near the airfoil leading edge
is heated by a conductive fin connecting the outer skin with the forward
passage of the gas supply duct. Because the gas supply duct is continuously 
heated, heat will be conducted through the fin to form a narrow, 
continuously heated parting strip. The width of the parting strip
is governed by the operational and icing conditions; a narrows parting
strip of about 0.5 to 1.0 inch is satisfactory for good ice removal and
for heat economy.<br>
Other methods for attaining a parting strip are by electric heating
or by a hot-gas supply duct independent of the one supplying the 
intermittently heated segments; An electrically heated parting strip has all
the inherent disadvantages of an electrical system, while an independent
gas supply duct for the parting strip has weight disadvantages and may
incur considerable heat losses.<br>
3. Chordwise ice-free parting strips are located between adjacent
intermittently heated airfoil segments. The parting strips are continuously 
heated by the gas supply duct in a manner similar to that used
for the spanwise parting. strip.</p>

is gas-heated to 12 percent of chord. The center segment of the wing
is 3 feet in span and contains most of the instrumentation while the top
and bottom segments are each 1.5 feet in span. All segments are capable
of being heated independently for cyclical ice removal.  </p>

found to be satisfactory at a gas flow of 800 pounds per hour, a heat-on

conditions, the parting strip was approximately 0.75 inch wide after
258 seconds of icing (fig. 3(a)). The heavy Ice formations at the lead-
ing edge were removed after 4 to 8 seconds of heating. Ice removal
occurred first on the top surface while the Ice on the lower surface shed
progressively aft from the parting strip. At the end of the heating
period (fig. 3(b)), no ice remained on the heated area with the exception
of small deposits on the last 4 inches of the heated lower surface (9 to
13 in. aft of leading edge). In this region, which is just rearward of
the plenum chamber partition, runback rivulets occasionally froze and
remained for two or three cycles before the larger accretions were
removed.</p>

<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The preliminary results obtained in an investigation of cyclical
de-icing with a gas-heated airfoil are summarized as follows:<br>
1. Satisfactory cyclical de-icing of an 8-foot chord NACA 651-212
series airfoil was achieved with a hot-gas system over a range of cycle
ratios from 10 to 26 and utilizing a continuously gas-heated parting
strip.<br>
2. In the range of conditions investigated, the prime variables in
the determination of the required heat input for cyclic ice removal were
the datum air temperature and the cycle ratio; heat-off period, liquid-water 
content, airspeed, and angle of attack had only secondary effects
on heat requirements.<br>
3. For minimum runback, efficient ice removal, and minimum total
heat input, short heat-on periods of about 15 seconds with heat-off
periods of approximately 260 seconds gave the best results.<br>
4. In general, the highest gas temperatures and flow rates usable
for a given operating and icing condition resulted in the shortest heat-on 
periods and the best ice removal.<br>

<p>SUMMARY<br>
The problems associated with providing icing protection for the
critical components of a typical turbojet transport airplane operating
over a range of probable icing conditions are analyzed and discussed.
Heating requirements for several thermal methods of protection are
evaluated and the airplane performance penalties associated with providing 
this protection from various energy sources are assessed.<br>
The continuous heating requirements for icing protection and the
associated airplane performance penalties for the turbojet transport
are considerably increased over those associated with lower-speed aircraft. 
Experimental results show that the heating requirements can be
substantially reduced by the development of a satisfactory cyclic de-icing 
system. The problem of providing protection can be minimized by
employing a proper energy source since the airplane performance penalties
vary considerably with the source of energy employed.<br>
The optimum icing protection system for the turbojet transport or
for any other particular aircraft cannot be generally specified; the
choice of the optimum system is dependent upon the specific characteristics 
of the airplane and engine, the flight plan, the probable icing
conditions, and the performance requirements of the aircraft.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
The introduction of the high-speed, high-altitude, turbine-powered
airplane for all-weather operation makes necessary a new appraisal of
the icing protection requirements. The unique design features and mode
of operation of the turbojet airplane may result in requirements for
adequate icing protection that are considerably different from conventional 
aircraft. In addition to operating at speed and altitude conditions 
differing greatly from current conventional aircraft, the turbojet
airplane has a high rate of fuel consumption and a restricted flight
plan. Thus, any penalties imposed upon the airplane performance by the
provision and operation of the icing protection system assume great
importance. These factors, together with the demand for all-weather
operation, require that careful consideration be given to the problems
associated with providing icing protection for the turbojet airplane.
The. major problems that must be considered are: (1) the conditions of
icing and the degree of protection required, (2) the method of protection 
and the associated protection requirements, and (3) the penalties
imposed by the protection system on the airplane performance. The purpose 
of this report is to analyze and evaluate the icing protection problem 
for a high-performance turbojet transport airplane in terms of these
three considerations.</p>

<p>From a modern perspective, even a 4 percent reduction in payload would be onerous for 
commercial airline operations,

<blockquote>
<p>Airplane Descent Performance<br>
During climb and cruise the turbojet engines are operated at relatively 
high power levels; however, during the descent portion of the
flight, it will be necessary to operate engines at much lower power
levels in order that the placard dive speed of the airplane will not
be exceeded. Therefore, the availability of energy from the turbojet
engine during descent is considerably lower than in either climb or
cruise. An electrical system operating with shaft power could provide
adequate protection during descent provided the generators were designed
to operate over a wide range of engine speeds. Also, turbine-inlet and
tail-pipe bleed temperatures are sufficient to provide protection even
at low engine speeds. <strong>Compressor-outlet temperatures are so low that
protection of the complete airplane during descent by means of compressor 
bleed air is doubtful;</strong> however, sufficient energy may be available
to prevent serious engine icing. Furthermore, it should be possible
at any time during descent to level out for a short period of time,
increase the engine power, and shed the ice formations.  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a major challenge for the proposed system. 
At the time, it may have been viewed as feasible, 
but from a modern perspective requiring 
a significant change in flight path would be impractical.  </p>
<p>Adequate heating at low engine power conditions (such as descent) 
is still a challenge today. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
Icing protection will be required for a typical high-speed, high-altitude 
turbojet transport airplane operating over a probable range of
icing conditions because aerodynamic heating is not sufficient to raise
the temperature of an unheated surface above the freezing level.
Icing protection for the turbojet airplane may be accomplished by
conventional hot-gas systems, although the heating requirements and
performance penalties are considerably increased from those now associated 
with lower-speed aircraft. Provision for this increased heat demand
necessitates a critical study of its effect on the performance of the
turbojet airplane, an airplane the operating criteria of which are
restricted even in ideal flight conditions.<br>
The maximum continuous hot-gas requirement for the turbojet
transport occurred near 15,000 feet and is approximately 7,500,000 Btu
per hour, with wing and tail protection comprising over 90 percent of
this total. The airplane protection requirement can be reduced to a
maximum of approximately 490,000 Btu per hour or 143 kilowatts by using
a cyclic electrical de-icing system.<br>
The problem of providing for the maximum continuous hot-gas requirement 
of 7,500,000 Btu per hour is minimized by employing the turbojet
engine as the heat source. This large heat requirement represents
approximately a 10-percent bleed of the engine air flow, assuming a
350 F initial gas temperature to the protection system. Use of a gas
cyclic de-icing system should reduce these requirements by approximately
70 to 80 percent.<br>
The airplane performance penalties chargeable to providing icing
protection vary considerably with the energy source employed. The proper 
selection of a heat source for an aircraft icing protection system
depends on several considerations such as effect on rate of climb and
on pay load, amount of time expected to be in icing, and practical design
limitations. On the basis of this investigation a continuous hot-gas
system with compressor-discharge air appears the most attractive for
short icing encounters if the high penalty on thrust or rate of climb
can be tolerated. By utilizing a gas cyclic de-icing system, the climb
and thrust penalties can be reduced considerably. For longer icing
times, a cyclic electrical de-icing or a continuous hot-gas system with
turbine-inlet or tail-pipe gas appears more feasible.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A continuous 10% bleed extraction for ice protection would be an onerous load. 
"Modern Icing Technology" <sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> says of compressor air extraction:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The performance loss in the engine is serious. An extraction of 1 per
cent of the airflow causes approximately a 2 per cent loss in thrust.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Note that this was for the turbojets of the era. 
For more current turbofan jet engines, the relationship is more complex, 
but let us call this an order of magnitude estimate.]  </p>
<p>It is clear that there was still much technical was development needed to achieve 
practical compressor bleed air heating for ice protection.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating did see use in the NACA-era. 
Two commercial jet transports introduced near the end of the NACA-era, 
the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, 
both had engine bleed compressed air heat anti-ice 
for the wing leading edges and the empennage. 
However, I view their designs as being more influenced by 
industry technology development and the prior 
engine exhaust heat and combustion air heating designs, 
rather than the NACA compressed air heating studies that 
were occurring at around the same time. 
The designs did not use the cycling deicing nor
the recirculating hot air supply proposed in 
several of the NACA studies. 
I characterize the industry anti-ice designs as more 
economical than the NACA studies. 
Anti-ice was used despite the NACA assessment that:  </p>

large and in some cases may be prohibitive. <sup id="fnref3:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compressed air heating is still commonly used in the larger jet transports
for wing ice protection 
(the Boeing 787, with electrothermal wing ice protection, 
is a notable exception). 
It is used in some smaller aircraft, 
but more commonly for engine inlet ice protection. 
Other means of wing ice protection 
are sometimes used on the smaller jet transports. </p>
<p>Adequate heating at low engine power conditions (such as descent) 
is still a challenge today. 
Some engines and airplanes use a 
higher than nominal idle setting in icing conditions
(set either by crew action or automatically). 
However, there are limits as to how much thrust can be boosted 
(one still has to be able to land the airplane). </p>
