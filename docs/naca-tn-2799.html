<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION
Solution of the general problem of heat and mass transfer from a
wetted surface in forced convection is quite involved and tedious.
The calculations that often must be made point by point along a surface
are complex even after the basic variables and ambient conditions have
been determined. The method of solution customarily performed involves
several trial-and-error calculations that are intermediate between the
final answer and the basic factors that define a particular anti-icing
situation.
This investigation was conducted at the NACA Lewis laboratory to
simplify the method of calculating heat and mass transfer after the basic
factors (such as ambient temperature, rate of water interception, and
relative velocity) are known. Calculations will be greatly simplified by
a fundamental rearrangement of terms in the conventional equations, which
will eliminate the trial-and-error calculations, and permit a rapid,
graphical solution. The solution will be limited to the normal range of
anti-icing conditions and to the case of surface temperatures above
32°F with liquid-water interception by the surface.</p>
<p>Heat transfer. - The heat transfer in forced convection from a surface 
subjected, to water impingement and. heated above 32°F has been represented 
by the total heat transferred. by convection and by evaporation
of surface water, plus the sensible heat change of the impinging water.
These heat-transfer processes are discussed in detail in references 1 to
5 and are summarized, in the following five conventional equations: </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Equations 1 to 5" src="images/naca-tn-2799/Equations1to5.png"> </p>
<p>Readers may recognize forms of equations 1 through 4 from <a href="/naca-arr-5g13.html">NACA-ARR-5G13</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Note that the evaporation equations (2) and (3) use the factor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    0.622 / cp
</code></pre></div>

<p>which differs from <a href="/messinger.html">Messinger</a> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, which used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    (Pr/Tr)**(2/3) * 0.622 / cp
    (Pr/Tr)**(2/3) = 1.12
    1.12 * 0.622 / cp
</code></pre></div>

<p>I think that equation (5) is a wet adiabatic calculation 
that assumes water drop temperatures are in equilibrium 
with the air as they approach a surface, 
although I could not find it in "references 1 to 5". 
I guess that I am not completely up on the "five conventional equations".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(The symbols used herein are given in the appendix.)
A solution of equation (1) requires the prior calculation of equations 
(2) to (5). Because of the dependence of ed on td and of el
on tl, equations (2) and (5) are both trial-and-error solutions. In
order to eliminate these laborious calculations, a single equation will
be derived containing only a minimum number of basic variables.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a simplified relation using the preceeding eight terms; 
the following assumptions are made:<br>
(1) In the air flow over a body, temperatures and pressures change
adiabatically too quickly to permit any change in the state of entrained
moisture; the local-stream vapor pressure (as shown in reference 2) is
then given by<br>
<img alt="Equation 6" src="images/naca-tn-2799/Equation6.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 2 is NACA-ARR-5G13. 
It is an alternative that was considered (not the only scenario presented) 
to the assumption that the water drops are in equilibrium with the air 
as they approach an object. 
<img alt="Equation 7" src="images/naca-tn-2799/Equation7.png"> 
Equation 7 is an incompressible approximation of Bernoulli's Law.</p>
<p>The simplified equations are regrouped: </p>
<p><img alt="Equations 8 and 9" src="images/naca-tn-2799/Equations8and9.png"> </p>
<p>Also note that equation (5) was quietly omitted. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further simplification is obtained by expressing the following minor
variables as constants near the middle of their expected range in anti-icing 
calculations:<br>
(1) Recovery factor R, assumed as 0.85, corresponding to the conservative 
case of laminar flow<br>
(2) Latent heat of vaporization L, assumed as 1066 Btu per pound,
corresponding to an average surface temperature of 50F<br>
(3) Ambient absolute temperature (for air density calculation),
assumed as 464R</p>

<p>Calculations here will be in SI units, with the exceptions of:<br>
- LWC, g/m^3<br>
- drop diameter, micrometer   </p>
<p>A curious unit appears in the description of density:
<img alt="rho term" src="images/naca-tn-2799/term_rho.png"> </p>
<p>From the units on g:
<img alt="g term" src="images/naca-tn-2799/term_g.png"> </p>
<p>I infer that the mass in the density is the archaic unit "slug" in disguise
(see <a href="/a-brief-digression-on-unit-systems.html">A Brief Digression on Unit Systems</a>).  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    slug = 32.2 lbm / (32.2 ft/s^2) =&gt; lbm-s^2/ft units

    τ4 = 0.622 * Le / cp * (pv / po)

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the preceding derivations, the assumption is made that the
moisture in the ambient air does not have time to change state during
the adiabatic pressure and temperature changes in the local air stream.
Because of the high speeds and short distances involved in most anti-
icing calculations, this assumption appears reasonable. Answers obtained
by use of this assumption do not differ appreciably from those using the
assumption of phase changes in equilibrium with the local air temperature. 
The difference between the two solutions is greatest when pl/p0
is most removed from unity and when low heating rates are used.  </p>
<p>Errors in the present graphical solution may become appreciable at
high subsonic speeds because an incompressible-flow relation was used in
eliminating the velocity-ratio term from the equations. Recovery factors
for wetted surfaces at high speeds may also deviate from the value
assumed herein. The errors in solution due to the temperature factors
that were taken as constants near the mean of their expected ranges are
in the order of 3 percent for the range of graph presented. The fore-
going errors are negligible, however, compared with the uncertainty and
the latitude involved in estimating values of the basic variables,
especially the water-interception rate and the beat-transfer coefficient. </p>
<p>The form of solution presented herein is intentionally made general
for maximum usage. The solution is applicable to practically any body
shape for which the flow conditions are known, and is not dependent upon
any specific assumptions as to body geometry, location of transition,
wetness of surface, and method or extent of heating. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-2799 presented a general solution, 
but it left to the user some of the hard parts of a complete solution, 
such as determining the 
heat transfer coefficient and the water catch rate. </p>
<p>The "pressure and temperature changes in the local air stream" 
over the surface is a feature that will be used in the next publication review in the 
<a href="/icing-thermodynamics.html">Icing Thermodynamics thread</a>, NACA-TN-2914,
although in the compressible flow form.</p>
