<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>A chordwise-sequenced zone heating ice shedding strategy was devised.  </li>
<li>The current 787 jet aircraft uses electrothermal heating for wing anti-icing and de-icing.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
Also, there are scale differences, as a wing airfoil 
usually has a larger chord length than a propeller. 
However, there are commonalities and some of the lessons learned 
may apply to each. </p>
<p>It is noted in <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a> 
that by 1943 NACA had aircraft with robust 
ice protection which enabled more extensive icing flight research, 
and that capability was used to improve propeller deicing.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
Flights were made in natural icing conditions at the
NACA Ice Research Project, Minneapolis, Minn. to test
several designs of thermal-electric propeller de-icing
blade shoes and a hub-generator design.
It was found
that a minimum average unit power of 2.5 watts per square
inch of blade-shoe area would protect the propeller blades
at the test conditions.
The most satisfactory blade shoe
of the three designs tested extended to the 20-percent
chord point and to 90 percent of the blade radius.
A concentration of heat in the leading-edge region of this
shoe was found to reduce the power input necessary for
satisfactory de-icing.
A satisfactory thermal design of
blade shoe and a hub generator of sufficient capacity
were developed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the second set of blade
shoes manufactured by the Goodrich company, designated as
shoe type 2, the radial heat distribution was uniform,
but in the chordwise direction the heat was concentrated
over tha leading-edge region (approximately the forward 7
percnt of the blade chord) of the blade-shoe area.
This heat distribution was obtained by a change in thickness
and hence in resistance of the conductive neoprene layer.
The blade area protected by the types 1 and 2 blade shoes
was the same, and the power inputs to the to types of
Goodrich blade shoe were equal at the same line voltage.  </p>
</blockquote>

The Type 2 blade shoe is similar, but to 0.07 chord the surface neoprene layer is thinner.

<p>The results of tests with the Goodrich type 2 blade
shoes are shown in figures 11 to 16.
All the tests were
run in the same icing condition, which was considered to
be of uniform severity.
Figure 11 shows the ice accretions on the test propeller, 
on the XB-17F airplane after
18 minutes in the icing condition with no heat supplied
to the blade shoes.
Figure 12 indicates that a supply of
402 watts to the blade shoe may have been enough to start
the ice~removal process, since the ice on the inner portion 
of the far blade and parts of the ice on the near
blade have been thrown off.
The location on the near
blade at which the ice has been thrown off has started to
ice again, indicating that there is some time interval
between the shedding of ice on the various portions of
the blade.
The shank of the far blade is clear, indicating recent de-icing.
The condition of the blade leading
edge indicates that the total power input to the three
blade-shoes was too low and allowed excessive ice.  </p>

The tests indicate that the final design of blade
shoe tested (type 2) and the 2000-watt hub-generator combination 
will de-ice the test propeller blades in icing
conditions similar to those encountered and should, after
service tests, provide an acceptable means of propeller
de-icing.<br>
Pending further tests, the following design principles are 
recommended:<br>
1. A minimum average unit power input of 2.5 watts
per square inch of blade-shoe area should be provided for
blade shoes covering the leading-edge 20-percent chord
and 90 percent of the blade radius.
2. The heat distribution should be such that the unit
heating supplied to the leading-edge 7-percent chord is
twice that supplied to the remainder of the blade-shoe area.</p>

<h2>"An Investigation Utilizing an Electrical Analogue of Cyclic De-Icing of a Hollow Steel Propeller with an External Blade Shoe", NACA-TN-2852 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
A study has been made of the heat requirement for the cyclic de-icing
of hollow steel propellers fitted with external blade heating shoes.
Solutions to the equations for the heat flow in cyclic heating of propellers 
were obtained, using an electrical analogy. The study showed how the
energy requirement for propeller de-icing with existing blade shoes could
be decreased, and illustrated the effect of blade-shoe design on the
energy requirement. It was demonstrated, for example, that by increasing
the heating intensity and decreasing the heating period from those currently 
used the energy requirement could be decreased in the order
of 60 percent. In addition, ft was shown that heating requirements could
be decreased further, by as much as 60 percent, through proper design of
the shoes. The investigation also showed the energy requirement to
increase with decreasing liquid-water content and air temperature. Uncertainties 
as to the exact values of convective heat-transfer coefficient
prevailing over the surface of the blade and ice layer resulted in uncertainties 
of approximately proportional magnitude in the values of required
heating intensity.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
Propeller ice protection for aircraft is generally provided by
electrical heating. In the development of external heating shoes, emphasis
was placed primarily on the determination of the heating intensity
required. Preliminary tests indicated power requirements for continuous
heating to be so large that cyclic operation, with attendant power savings,
was almost mandatory. Subsequent tests (reference 1) included some variation 
in cyclic time and other pertinent factors, but were mainly concerned
with heating pattern and heating intensity for one blade and shoe configuration.<br>
Tests of cyclically operated propeller blade shoes have been too
limited in scope to provide a comprehensive picture of the effects of
various parameters on blade-shoe performance. Electrical simulation of
the flow of heat from the heating element of a blade shoe during cyclic
operation offered a means for obtaining more complete data on cyclic
de-icing. By use of an electrical analogy, a large range of configura-
tions and operating conditions could be covered readily. Such a study
of a similar problem was first made by Tribus (reference 2). This work
was limited in it scope, reproducing portions of the data obtained in
reference 1 and covering only the general aspects of the problem.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT  </p>
<p>Electrical Analogue<br>
The electrical analogue used. in the study of cyclic de-icing is
shown in figure 1. The analogue consists essentially of a network of
electrical resistances and capacitances connected in such a manner as to
simulate a thermal circuit. In the electrical circuit, electrical
resistance and capacitance represent thermal resistance and capacitance,
current flow represents heat flow, and voltage difference represents 
temperature difference. The resistances of the analogue network consist
of potentiometers connected as rheostats, while the capacitances consist
of condensers which were connected to obtain the desired values. The
method of utilizing an electrical analogy for the solution of transient
heat-flow problems is thoroughly treated in references 3, 11, and 5.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Special Circuits</p>
<p>Intermittent application of current, representative of cyclic heating, 
was accomplished by means of a switching system actuated by a synchronous 
electric motor. Since the power input to the blade shoe is
constant during the heating part of the cycle, a source of constant 
current was provided for the electrical simulation of power input to the
heater element. Additional constant-current circuits were arranged to
represent the application of heat at the blade surface resulting from
aerodynamic heating and release of the heat of fusion of the supercooled
drops impinging on the blade surface as they solidified to ice.<br>
To represent the periodic accumulation of ice on the blade shoe,
relay circuits were employed which switched in resistors and condensers
representing the equivalent values of thermal resistance and capacitance
of the ice layers. The continuous growth of the ice formation was 
represented in the analogy, using the assumption that the ice built up in 
three layers of equal volume throughout each cycle. Periodic precharging of
these condensers, just prior to their connection into the circuit, to
represent the increase in temperature of the ice layers due to the addition 
of aerodynamic heating and release of the heat of fusion of the ice
upon formation was achieved by means of a circuit utilizing the 
constant-current power supply and the ice-accumulation relays. 
These relays were
synchronized with the cyclic heating through the same switching system.<br>
Because during application of heat certain portions of the blade-shoe 
surface underneath the ice formation reached the melting point of
ice before release of the formation, special circuits, termed 
"heat-of-fusion circuits," were provided which held the surface temperature of
these regions at a constant voltage representing 32 F until release of 
the ice accumulation. This represented the absorption of heat by the
ice layer during the melting process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS<br>
The following conclusions have been reached as the result of an
analytical study of cyclic de-icing with blade heating shoes mounted on
a hollow steel propeller. The percentage values of energy saving presented 
apply directly only to the case of hollow steel blades of approximately 
the same configuration as that tested. However, the general
conclusions are applicable to all propeller blades fitted with external
heating shoes. All cyclic heating durations are based on a total cycle
time of 80 seconds.<br>
1. Considerable saving of energy can be effected with blade shoes
currently in operation by applying higher heating intensities for shorter
durations of time than are generally in use. For the case of conventional
shoes of the type commonly used, by operating at a 5-second duration of
heating time, the total energy can be decreased to about 40 percent of
that required for operation at a 20-second heating duration.<br>
2. Considerable saving of energy can be effected through proper
design of blade shoes. For example, if the thickness of the insulation
layer above the heater of a conventional blade shoe is decreased by a
factor of 2 and the thickness of the insulation below the heater is
doubled, the energy can be decreased to about 70 percent of that required
for a conventional shoe operated at the same cyclic ratios. Through
appropriate design and selection of insulating materials, the energy
requirement can be decreased to a value approaching 38 percent of that
needed for a conventional shoe operated at 5-seconds heating time.<br>
3. The maximum heater temperatures reached under conditions of
efficient de-icing for the above cases are relatively independent of
heating intensity, and are well within safe limits of operation for existing 
insulation materials.<br>
4. As the liquid-water content of the air stream increases, the
energy required to remove ice from the propeller decreases. Meteorological
conditions which impose the most stringent heating requirements on a
cyclically heated propeller are low values of liquid-water content together
with low air temperatures.<br>
5. Uncertainties as to the exact values of convective heat-transfer
coefficient prevailing over the surface of the blade and ice layer result 
in uncertainties of approximately proportional magnitude in the values
of required heating intensity.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decreasing the insulation thickness above the heater 
may increase thermal performance, but there are limits. 
The durability is generally reduced as the insulation 
thickness gets thinner. 
Rain erosion is a challenge for propellers, and wing leading edges at jet airspeed. 
Some designs incorporate a metal erosion shield on the outer surface. </p>
<p>Uncertainties about heat transfer coefficients continue to this day. 
NACA-TN-2852 assumed a +/-20% uncertainty, which is probably optimistic. 
If one's design and analysis are not robust 
to at least that range of variation, 
perhaps one should reconsider the design.  </p>

<p>Limiting the amount of runback ice is a challenge. 
As some liquid water forms in the deicing process, 
that water is available to runback and form ice.  </p>

<p>Typical de-icing and growth of the runback formation are shown
in figure 22. The pictures were taken during cyclic operation through
transparent sections in the tunnel side walls and show the lower surface

The ice formation after 8 minutes and 20 seconds, or just before
the second heat-on period, is illustrated in figure 22(a). The main ice
formation is shown and very slight amounts of runback ice may be seen on
the unheated portion of the heater. The next picture, figure 22(b),
taken after the third heat-on period, shows the removal of the main ice
formation and a slight increase in runback ice. Figure 22(c), taken
just before the ninth heat-on period, shows that the runback formation
has increased in size although very little in extent. The frost formations 
that have started to form downstream of the heated area are typical 
of those obtained in all tests and appear to be inherent to tunnel
operation. These frost formations increased in size and extent with
increasing amounts of runback and residual ice.<br>

<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
For the range of variables investigated, the following results and
conclusions may be stated:<br>
1. A continuously heated parting strip in conjunction with cyclic
heating was found necessary to insure quick, complete, and. consistent
ice removal. A 1-inch-wide continuously heated strip at the leading edge
was sufficient for the range of datum temperatures from 19° to -11° F.<br>
2. The most important variables in determining the cyclic power
requirements are the datum temperature and the heat-on time; the heat-
off time, the liquid-water content, and the droplet size have a second-
order effect, and the angle of attack has no appreciable effect.<br>
3. For the most efficient removal of ice, minimum runback ice, and
minimum total energy input, the condition of high local power density
and short (less than 15 seconds) heating period gave the best results.<br>
4. The optimum cycled heat input distribution pattern consisted of
a uniform power density for the region of water impingement. Extensive
heating beyond the impingement region did not aid materially in de-icing
performance or in eliminating runback ice.<br>
5. The experimental heater was found to have a rather low thermal
efficiency. Better de-icing performance and further economies in the
energy requirement would be obtained using a heater having a lower
thermal capacity and a smaller thermal resistance between the heater
elements and the outer surface.<br>
6. Ice removal did not take place on attainment of a heater surface
temperature of 32° F. For complete ice removal, peak surface temperatures 
of approximately 50° to 100° F resulted with a finite but undetermined 
water film formed underneath the ice formation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item 6 is a key point. 
In some colder areas, the ice may remain attached, 
while most other areas are well above the melting point. 
There is an opportunity for much melting and runback 
formation while waiting for the last attached areas to melt and shed. 
Ice can be surprisingly strong, with even "thin" ice able to bridge 
apparently widely spaced contact adhesion points. </p>
<h2>"De-Icing and Runback Characteristics of Three Cyclic Electric, External Deicing Boots Employing Chordwise Shedding", NACA-RM-E53C26 <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas previous NACA investigations of cyclic de-icing have all
employed, models using the principle of spanwise shedding, the boots
included in this investigation employed the principle of chordwise shedding 
of ice. Chordwise shedding differs from spanwise shedding only in
the manner in which the cycled portions of the boot are divided into
segments. A sketch showing two hypothetical de-icing-boot installations
on the wing of the same fighter-type jet aircraft is shown In figure 2.
The boot shown in figure 2(a) provides spanwise shedding of ice, whereas
the boot installation shown in figure 2(b) provides chordwise shedding.<br>
If the boots are assumed to be comparable in every respect, the
boot employing spanwise shedding might operate as follows: Heat is
first applied to cycled area 1 (upper and lower surface) for a specified
period of time. When heat is discontinued on area 1, it is immediately
applied to area 2; proceeding in a spanwise direction until all areas
have been heated. For the case of chordwise shedding (fig. 2(b)), the
boat is divided into six segments distributed three on the upper and
three on the lower surface of the airfoil. Heat might again be applied
first to area 1, then to area 2, and so forth, progressing in a chordwise 
direction across the upper surface of the airfoil and then in like
manner across the lower surface.<br>
For purposes of identification throughout this report, the three
boots employed in the investigation are labeled A, B, and C, and the
cycled segments of each boot are labeled as shown in figure 3. The
first letter of the segment notation (A, B, or C) denotes the boot which
contains the segment; the second letter (u or L) denotes upper or lower
surface; and the number in the segment notation indicates the relative
position of the segment with respect to the parting strip. For example,
segment BU2 is the second segment of boot B aft of the parting strip

<p>The internal circuitry of the boots was quite similar. The circuitry 
of each segment of each boot (including the parting strip) was
arranged in a series-parallel circuit as shown by the schematic diagram
presented In figure 5. For boots B and C, several sets of individual
heater wires arranged in parallel were wound back and forth spanwise in
each segment of the boot. At the spanwise end of each segment, the wires
were fastened to electrically conductive strips. In general, the method
of construction employed for boot A was similar to that employed for
boots B and C, except that in this case, the sets of wires ran back and
forth chordwise and were fastened to bus bars which ran in a spanwise
direction (see fig. 4). The location of bus bars shown in figure 5 is
representative of boots B and C. All segments of the boots were internally 
connected to a common ground.<br>
The model employed in the icing investigation of the various boots
was an NACA 65-213 airfoil section having a 9.3° leading-edge sweepback,
an 82.3-inch chord at the center line, and a 71-inch total span. The
model is symmetrical about the center line and was mounted vertically
in the 6- by 9-foot test section of the icing research tunnel. The airfoil 
was constructed similarly to an actual wing section of the particular 
fighter-type jet airplane for which the boots were designed and,
hence, incorporated taper in addition to the leading-edge sweepback. A
schematic drawing of the model employed in the investigation is shown
in figure 6.</p>

<p>General De-Icing and Runback Characteristics<br>
The icing and runback characteristics of boots A, B, and C operating
with the local surface temperatures and the temperature distributions
presented in figures 7 and 8 are shown in figure 13. The photographs
show the appearance of the upper surface of the boots after 14 and
22 minutes in the following icing conditions: free-stream total temperature, 
15° F; free-stream velocity, 396 feet per second; liquid-water
content, 0.57 grain per cubic meter; and angle of attack, 2°. It is
apparent that, for these icing conditions, none of the boots provide
complete shedding of ice from the surface for operation at design power
densities and heat-on time. For longer periods of time in the abovementioned 
icing condition, the amount of ice adhering to boots B and C
remained relatively unchanged, while the amount of ice adhering to
boot A increased slightly, which indicated that boot A provides only
marginal icing protection for the condition listed. The photographs
showing boots A and B indicate the amount of residual ice after the
application of heat to segments AU3 and BU3. The photograph of boot C
was taken the instant heat was discontinued on segment CU2 and applied
to segment CU3. The ice adhering to segments CU3 and CU4 shed clean
when heat was applied to these segments.<br>
The photographs shown in figure 13 are typical of the comparative
de-icing characteristics of the boots operating in similar icing conditions. 
In general, for the icing conditions investigated, no appreciable 
differences in the performance characteristics of boots B and C
were observed. Boot B had a fine-textured clothlike surface as compared
with the smoother surface of boot C, but this slight difference in surface 
roughness had little or no effect on ice removal. As evidenced in
figure 13, the amount of icing protection afforded by boot A was
slightly lower than that of the other two boots; and, hence, the boot
provides marginal protection at a slightly higher value of free-stream
temperature than does boot B or C, other conditions being equal. In
general, for a free-stream velocity of about 395 feet per second, an
angle of attack of 2°, and a liquid-water content of 0.5 to 0.6 grain per
cubic meter, the range of free-stream total temperatures at which the
icing protection afforded by the various boots became marginal was from
12° to 15° F. The slightly lower performance characteristics observed
for boot A are attributable to the internal construction of the boot.
The presence of rather large bus bars (which act as heat sinks), small
unheated areas between all cycled segments, and heater wires running
parallel to the airflow at 1/8-inch spacing all contribute to local
cold spots from which ice fails to shed during heat-on time. The ice
adhering between segments of boot A (fig. 13) is typical of the icing
characteristics of the boot. In some cases the ice adhering between
segments formed ahead of and behind the small unheated areas between
segments to a length of 1 inch or more without adhering to the heated
areas. In figure 13(a) it can be noted that considerable ice has formed
on the unheated area between the parting strip and the forward cycled
segment.<br>
A comparison of figures 13(a), (b), and (c) shows that the runback
pattern obtained for the boots in the icing condition listed is quite
similar, with no runback occurring on the aluminum skin behind, the boot
scarf. The runback is a smooth clear ice formation not exceeding
1/8 inch in thickness on the upper surface.</p>

<p>As a result of the icing investigation, it was found that the forward 
cycled segments, upper, and lower surfaces, were the most critical
areas for the three boots investigated. Bridging of the parting strip
occurred at the more severe icing conditions included in the investigation. 
In some cases, parting-strip surface temperatures in excess of
75° F were recorded without effecting removal of the ice cap. Although
considerable melting occurred beneath the ice cap and the resulting water
melted holes through portions of the cap, the inability of the forward
cycled segments to melt the bond prevented ice removal.  </p>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The following results were obtained from an icing investigation of
three production samples of electric, cyclic de-icing boots.<br>
1. The forward cycled segments, upper and lower surfaces, of all
three boots were the most critical areas for the icing conditions 
investigated.<br>
2. Unheated areas as small as 1/8 inch wide occurring in the heated
surface of an external, rubber-clad, electric, cyclic de-icing-boot
contributed to local cold spots on which ice forms.<br>
3. The runback characteristics of the three boots were similar.<br>
4. The performance characteristics of two of the three boots were
very similar. The icing protection afforded by the boot having small
unheated areas existing between segments was slightly less than that of
the other two boots.<br>
5. For icing conditions investigated at free-stream total temperature 
of 15 ° F and less, the detrimental effect of-the small amount of
runback ice observed is probably small in comparison with the effect of
ice adhering to the surface of the boot just aft of the parting strip
because of incomplete shedding.<br>
6. For a free-stream velocity of 395 feet per second and an angle of
attack of 2°, the range of free-stream total temperatures at which the
icing protection afforded by the various boots became marginal was from
12° to 15° F for the values of liquid-water content included in the
investigation.  </p>

<p>While a direct comparison was not included, 
chordwise shedding often results in less runback ice 
than spanwise shedding. </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Electrothermal heating is still used today for propeller ice protection. 
Use for wing ice protection is less common, 
although the current 787 jet aircraft uses electrotherm wing ice protection
(we will discuss that more in the upcoming "Conclusions of the Ice Protection Thread").  </p>
<p>Electrothermal ice protection is used widely today for many smaller components, 
including windshields and air data probes. </p>
