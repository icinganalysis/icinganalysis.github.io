<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>The current 787 jet aircraft uses electrothermal heating for wing anti-icing and de-icing.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
However, there are commonalities and some of the lessons learned 
may apply to each. </p>
<p>It is noted in "We Freeze" that by 1943 NACA had aircraft with robust 
ice protection which enabled more extensive icing flight research, 
and that capability was used to improve propeller deicing. </p>
<h2>"Tests of Thermal-Electric De-Icing Equipment for Propellers", NACA-ARR-4A20</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
Flights were made in natural icing conditions at the
NACA Ice Research Project, Minneapolis, Minn. to test
several designs of thermal-electric propeller de-icing
blade shoes and a hub-generator design.
It was found
that a minimum average unit power of 2.5 watts per square
inch of blade-shoe area would protect the propeller blades
at the test conditions.
The most satisfactory blade shoe
of the three designs tested extended to the 20-percent
chord point and to 90 percent of the blade radius.
A concentration of heat in the leading-edge region of this
shoe was found to reduce the power input necessary for
satisfactory de-icing.
A satisfactory thermal design of
blade shoe and a hub generator of sufficient capacity
were developed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the second set of blade
shoes manufactured by the Goodrich company, designated as
shoe type 2, the radial heat distribution was uniform,
but in the chordwise direction the he at was concentrated
over tha leading-edge region (approximately the forward 7
percnt of the blade chord) of the blade-shoe area.
This heat distribution was obtained by a change in thickness
and hence in resistance of the conductive neoprene layer.
The blade area protected by the types 1 and 2 blade shoes
was the same, and the power inputs to the to types of
Goodrich blade shoe were equal at the same line voltage.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4. Sections of the blead shoes tested. 
The Hamilton Standard blade shoe has small resistance wires embedded in a moulded shoe place on the propeller surface, up to 0.20 chord. 
The Type 1 blade shoe has a conduction layer between insulating layers. 
The Type 2 blade shoe is similar, but to 0.07 chord the surface neoprene layer is thinner.
" src="images/NACA-ARR-4A20/Figure 4.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of tests with the Goodrich type 2 blade
shoes are shown in figures 11 to 16.
All the tests were
run in the same icing condition, which was considered to
be of uniform severity.
Figure 11 shows the ice accretions on the test propeller, 
on the XB-17F airplane after
18 minutes in the icing condition with no heat supplied
to the blade shoes.
Figure 12 indicates that a supply of
402 watts to the blade shoe may have been enough to start
the ice~removal process, since the ice on the inner portion 
of the far blade and parts of the ice on the near
blade have been thrown off.
The location on the near
blade at which the ice has been thrown off has started to
ice again, indicating that there is some time interval
between the shedding of ice on the various portions of
the blade.
The shank of the far blade is clear, indicating recent de-icing.
The condition of the blade leading
edge indicates that the total power input to the three
blade-shoes was too low and allowed excessive ice.  </p>

<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
The tests indicate that the final design of blade
shoe tested (type 2) and the 2000-watt hub-generator combination 
will de-ice the test propeller blades in icing
conditions similar to those encountered and should, after
service tests, provide an acceptable means of propeller
de-icing.<br>
Pending further tests, the following design principles are 
recommended:<br>
1. A minimum average unit power input of 2.5 watts
per square inch of blade-shoe area should be provided for
blade shoes covering the leading-edge 20-percent chord
and 90 percent of the blade radius.
2. The heat distribution should be such that the unit
heating supplied to the leading-edge 7-percent chord is
twice that supplied to the remainder of the blade-shoe area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
A study has been made of the heat requirement for the cyclic de-icing
of hollow steel propellers fitted with external blade heating shoes.
Solutions to the equations for the heat flow in cyclic heating of propellers 
were obtained, using an electrical analogy. The study showed how the
energy requirement for propeller de-icing with existing blade shoes could
be decreased, and illustrated the effect of blade-shoe design on the
energy requirement. It was demonstrated, for example, that by increasing
the heating intensity and decreasing the heating period from those currently 
used the energy requirement could be decreased in the order
of 60 percent. In addition, ft was shown that heating requirements could
be decreased further, by as much as 60 percent, through proper design of
the shoes. The investigation also showed the energy requirement to
increase with decreasing liquid-water content and air temperature. Uncertainties 
as to the exact values of convective heat-transfer coefficient
prevailing over the surface of the blade and ice layer resulted in uncertainties 
of approximately proportional magnitude in the values of required
heating intensity.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
Propeller ice protection for aircraft is generally provided by
electrical heating. In the development of external heating shoes, emphasis
was placed primarily on the determination of the heating intensity
required. Preliminary tests indicated power requirements for continuous
heating to be so large that cyclic operation, with attendant power savings,
was almost mandatory. Subsequent tests (reference 1) included some variation 
in cyclic time and other pertinent factors, but were mainly concerned
with heating pattern and heating intensity for one blade and shoe configuration.<br>
Tests of cyclically operated propeller blade shoes have been too
limited in scope to provide a comprehensive picture of the effects of
various parameters on blade-shoe performance. Electrical simulation of
the flow of heat from the heating element of a blade shoe during cyclic
operation offered a means for obtaining more complete data on cyclic
de-icing. By use of an electrical analogy, a large range of configura-
tions and operating conditions could be covered readily. Such a study
of a similar problem was first made by Tribus (reference 2). This work
was limited in it scope, reproducing portions of the data obtained in
reference 1 and covering only the general aspects of the problem.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT  </p>
<p>Electrical Analogue<br>
The electrical analogue used. in the study of cyclic de-icing is
shown in figure 1. The analogue consists essentially of a network of
electrical resistances and capacitances connected in such a manner as to
simulate a thermal circuit. In the electrical circuit, electrical
resistance and capacitance represent thermal resistance and capacitance,
current flow represents heat flow, and voltage difference represents 
temperature difference. The resistances of the analogue network consist
of potentiometers connected as rheostats, while the capacitances consist
of condensers which were connected to obtain the desired values. The
method of utilizing an electrical analogy for the solution of transient
heat-flow problems is thoroughly treated in references 3, 11, and 5.  </p>

<p>"Modern Icing Technology" by Tribus, while not referenced by NACA-TN-2852, 
(his 1949 thesis was referenced) 
has a figure to illustrate the type of analog circuits:  </p>

and also into the steel blade below. 
Part C shows an analog circuit with many pairs of resistors and capacitors." src="images/Modern Icing Technology/Figure VII-6.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special Circuits</p>
<p>Intermittent application of current, representative of cyclic heating, 
was accomplished by means of a switching system actuated by a synchronous 
electric motor. Since the power input to the blade shoe is
constant during the heating part of the cycle, a source of constant 
current was provided for the electrical simulation of power input to the
heater element. Additional constant-current circuits were arranged to
represent the application of heat at the blade surface resulting from
aerodynamic heating and release of the heat of fusion of the supercooled
drops impinging on the blade surface as they solidified to ice.<br>
To represent the periodic accumulation of ice on the blade shoe,
relay circuits were employed which switched in resistors and condensers
representing the equivalent values of thermal resistance and capacitance
of the ice layers. The continuous growth of the ice formation was 
represented in the analogy, using the assumption that the ice built up in 
three layers of equal volume throughout each cycle. Periodic precharging of
these condensers, just prior to their connection into the circuit, to
represent the increase in temperature of the ice layers due to the addition 
of aerodynamic heating and release of the heat of fusion of the ice
upon formation was achieved by means of a circuit utilizing the 
constant-current power supply and the ice-accumulation relays. 
These relays were
synchronized with the cyclic heating through the same switching system.<br>
Because during application of heat certain portions of the blade-shoe 
surface underneath the ice formation reached the melting point of
ice before release of the formation, special circuits, termed 
"heat-of-fusion circuits," were provided which held the surface temperature of
these regions at a constant voltage representing 32 F until release of 
the ice accumulation. This represented the absorption of heat by the
ice layer during the melting process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS<br>
The following conclusions have been reached as the result of an
analytical study of cyclic de-icing with blade heating shoes mounted on
a hollow steel propeller. The percentage values of energy saving presented 
apply directly only to the case of hollow steel blades of approximately 
the same configuration as that tested. However, the general
conclusions are applicable to all propeller blades fitted with external
heating shoes. All cyclic heating durations are based on a total cycle
time of 80 seconds.<br>
1. Considerable saving of energy can be effected with blade shoes
currently in operation by applying higher heating intensities for shorter
durations of time than are generally in use. For the case of conventional
shoes of the type commonly used, by operating at a 5-second duration of
heating time, the total energy can be decreased to about 4O percent of
that required for operation at a 20-second heating duration.<br>
2. Considerable saving of energy can be effected through proper
design of blade shoes. For example, if the thickness of the insulation
layer above the heater of a conventional blade shoe is decreased by a
factor of 2 and the thickness of the insulation below the heater is
doubled, the energy can be decreased to about 70 percent of that required
for a conventional shoe operated at the same cyclic ratios. Through
appropriate design and selection of insulating materials, the energy
requirement can be decreased to a value approaching 38 percent of that
needed for a conventional shoe operated at 5-seconds heating time.<br>
3. The maximum heater temperatures reached under conditions of
efficient de-icing for the above cases are relatively independent of
heating intensity, and are well within safe limits of operation for existing 
insulation materials.<br>
4. As the liquid-water content of the air stream increases, the
energy required to remove ice from the propeller decreases. Meteorological
conditions which impose the most stringent heating requirements on a
cyclically heated propeller are low values of liquid-water content together
with low air temperatures.<br>
5. Uncertainties as to the exact values of convective heat-transfer
coefficient prevailing over the surface of the blade and ice layer result 
in uncertainties of approximately proportional magnitude in the values
of required heating intensity.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decreasing the insulation thickness above the heater 
may increase thermal performance, but there are limits. 
The durability is generally reduced as the insulation 
thickness gets thinner. 
Rain erosion is a challenge for propellers, and wing leading edges at jet airspeed. 
Some designs incorporate a metal erosion shield on the outer surface. </p>
<p>Uncertainties about heat transfer coefficients continue to this day. 
NACA-TN-2852 assumed a +/-20% uncertainty, which is probably optimistic. 
If ones' design and analysis are not robust to at least that range of variation, 
perhaps one should reconsider the design.  </p>
<h2>The 787 wing ice protection system</h2>
<p>I was the principal investigator of the 7E7 (a study airplane configuration) technology development for wing ice protection. 
The 7E7 study selected electrothermal ice protection. 
The 7E7 soon became the Boeing 787, a twin-engine jet with largely composite structure. </p>
<p>An article describes some of the rationale for the "no bleed" architecture.<br>
<a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_06/article_04_3.html">NO BLEED, MORE ELECTRIC SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE</a>  </p>
<p>While there are numerous instructive details about the design, 
many are proprietary to three entities (Boeing, GKN, and Ultra Electronics). 
It is difficult to publish much about the system without all three involved, 
and I have seen few details published. </p>
<p>While the NACA lessons learned noted above are valuable, 
there are details to be worked out 
to applying the general technology to a specific application. </p>
