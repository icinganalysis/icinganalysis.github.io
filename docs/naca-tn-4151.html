<h2>Summary</h2>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>NACA-TN-4155:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effects of ice formations on the section lift, drag, and
pitching-moment coefficients of an unswept NACA 65A004 airfoil section
of 6-foot chord were studied. The magnitude of the aerodynamic penalties
was primarily a function of the shape and size of the ice formation near
the leading edge of the airfoil. The exact size and shape of the ice
formations were determined photographically and found to be complex
functions of the operating and icing conditions.  </p>
<p>In general, icing of the airfoil at angles of attack less than 40
caused large increases in section drag coefficients (as much as 350
percent in 8 minutes of heavy glaze icing), reductions in section lift
coefficients (up to 13 percent), and changes in the pitching-moment
coefficient from diving toward climbing moments.  </p>
<p>At angles of attack greater than 40 the aerodynamic characteristics
depended mainly on the ice type. The section drag coefficients generally
were reduced by the addition of rime ice (by as much as 45 percent in
8 minutes of icing). In glaze icing, however, the drag increased at
these angles of attack. The section lift coefficients were variably
affected by rime-ice formations; however, in glaze icing, lift increases
at high angles of attack amounted to as much as 9 percent for an icing
time of 8 minutes. Pitching-moment-coefficient changes in icing conditions 
were somewhat erratic and depended on the icing condition.  </p>
<p>Rotation of the iced airfoil to angles of attack other than that
at which icing occurred caused sufficiently large changes in the pitching-moment 
coefficient that, in flight, rapid corrections in trim might be
required in order to avoid a hazardous situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-4151:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An empirical relation has been obtained by which the change in drag
coefficient caused by ice formations on an unswept NACA 65AO04 airfoil
section can be determined from the following icing and operating conditions:
icing time, airspeed, air total temperature, liquid-water content, cloud
droplet impingement efficiencies, airfoil chord length, and angles of
attack. The correlation was obtained by use of measured ice heights and
ice angles. These measurements were obtained from a variety of ice formations, 
which were carefully photographed, cross-sectioned, and weighed.
Ice weights increased at a constant rate with icing time in a rime icing
condition and at progressively increasing rates in glaze icing conditions.
Initial rates of ice collection agreed reasonably well with values predicted 
from droplet impingement data. Experimental droplet impingement
rates obtained on this airfoil section agreed with previous theoretical
calculations for angles of attack of 40 or less. Disagreement at higher
angles of attack was attributed to flow separation from the upper surface
of the experimental airfoil model.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>These two publications have an author in common, were published the same month, and reference each other, and so are reviewed together. 
NACA-TN-4155 may be thought of as the lab report documenting the icing wind tunnel test results, 
and NACA-TN-4151 as an analysis report of the test results to develop correlations. </p>
<p>These are relatively long (46 and 48 pages), so highly condensed summaries will follow.

<h3>NACA-TN-4155</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]ublished aerodynamic data are useful for estimating the performance
penalties in icing conditions for large transport and bomber aircraft,
but are not readily applicable to high-speed high-altitude interceptor
aircraft because such aircraft generally utilize a very thin airfoil
(thickness ratio of the order of 4 percent). These interceptor aircraft
cruise at altitudes at which little, if any, icing occurs. The icing,
problem of these aircraft is confined primarily to climb and descent,
which are generally of short duration because of the high rates of climb
and descent. The aircraft may occasionally be required to loiter during
letdown at altitudes where icing can occur; however, because the over-all
icing hazard is much reduced for these aircraft compared to conventional
transport aircraft, the elimination of airframe icing protection equip-
ment appears attractive. It is therefore necessary to determine the
aerodynamic penalties caused by icing of thin airfoil sections in order
to assess the need for icing protection equipment on lifting and control
surfaces of high-speed interceptor aircraft.</p>
<p>In order to provide such data for use in interceptor-aircraft mission 
analyses, studies were made in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel of the
aerodynamic penalties associated with icing of an unswept NACA 65A004
airfoil section of 6-foot chord. These studies included the effect of
icing on the airfoil-section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients.
In addition, photographs of the cross sections of the ice formations
causing the changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil
were obtained.</p>
<p>APPARATUS<br>
The model consisted of an NACA 65A004 airfoil section of 6-foot
chord. (Coordinates for this section are given in ref. 4). The model
was mounted vertically to span the 6-foot height of the Lewis icing
tunnel (fig. 1). The airfoil was equipped with a 42-inch-span removable
leading-edge section that provided for installation of a variety of
icing protection systems. For this study, however, the removable section
was constructed of wood and covered with a sheet of 0.010-inch-thick
neoprene to prevent abrasion of the surface. The leading-edge section
extended to 27 percent of the chord. The remainder of the airfoil sec-
tion was constructed of stainless steel and was internally steam heated
to prevent the accumulation of frost due to tunnel-air supersaturation
and turbulence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All initial values of section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients 
for the clean airfoil are corrected for tunne1-wall interference
effects by use of equations given in reference 10. In general, compared
with the measured values for the clean airfoil, the corrected lift was
approximately 16 percent less, the corrected drag about 8 percent less,
the corrected pitching moment up to 18 percent more negative at high
angles of attack, and the corrected angle of attack a maximum of about.
12 percent greater.<br>
Analysis of the effect of tunnel-wall interference on changes in
the airfoil aerodynamic characteristics caused by ice formations showed
negligible corrections. To obtain absolute values of the respective
coefficients for the iced airfoil, the corrected initial coefficients are
added to the uncorrected changes in coefficients caused by icing.<br>
Except as noted, the data shown are in terms of changes in the aerodynamic 
characteristics of the airfoil with duration in icing. In the
calculations of all aerodynamic coefficients the increase in planform area
caused by the ice formations (less than 3 percent) was neglected.</p>
<p>Ice-Formation Characteristics<br>
Typical photographs of ice formations observed on the leading-edge
region of the airfoil are shown in figures 6 to 8. These ice formations
fit into the general categories of glaze, intermediate, and rime ice.
The glaze-ice formations (fig. 6(a)) are characterized by bluff nearly
transparent ice caps that protrude from the surface normal to the local
airstream.</p>
<p>Variation of Aerodynamic Characteristics with Icing Time, Ice Shape, and Angle of Attack<br>
The changes in section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients
with icing time obtained in this study are shown in figures 9 and 10
for various constant angles of attack. Also shown in these figures are
cross sections of the ice deposits on the leading-edge region of the
airfoil. These sketches were traced from photographs of the ice taken
at the end of the runs (similar to those shown in figs. 6 to 8) and
depict the ice shapes for only about the forward 7 percent of the airfoil.  </p>

<p>(There are numerous photos of the ice shapes and effects cases, here is only a sample.)

<blockquote>
<p>In general, analysis of the aerodynamic data and the ice-formation
photographs showed that, in icing conditions, changes in the aerodynamic
characteristics of the airfoil were related to the size and shape of the
ice formations. The ice size and the resulting changes in aerodynamic
coefficients generally increased progressively with increasing icing
time. With ice classified as glaze, rime, or intermediate, the general
trends in the aerodynamic changes due to ice shown in figures 9 and 10
can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="Table of effects" src="images/naca-tn-4155/Table of effects.png"></p>
<h3>NACA-TN-4151</h3>
<p>Very briefly, the ice shapes from NACA-TN-4155 were measured and tabulated in Table II,
which is too extensive to reproduce here. 
Correlations were then developed. </p>
<h3>Different coordinates from NACA-TR-446</h3>
<p>The coordinate system of NACA-TR-446 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, x/chord and h/chord, 
were apparently considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ice deposits in the present study are represented by two dimensions, 
h and θ, as shown in figure 7. Dimension h is the height of
the edge of the ice first reached in going from the upper to the lower
surface. The angle θ is measured between this ice edge and the extended
chord line. The angle is positive if above the chord line and negative if
the ice edge falls below the extended chord line. These measurements are
given in table II for most of the icing runs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 7" src="images/naca-tn-4151/Figure 7.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representation of ice formations by these two dimensions only ignores
the part of the ice toward and on the lower surface of the airfoil.
Generally, protuberances on this region contribute very little drag to
the airfoil, except near zero angle of attack. In contrast, flow spoilers
near the leading edge and toward the upper surface cause large drag
increases; this surfacewise variation in effect of spoilers is illustrated
in reference 11 and is directly related to the local-velocity distribution
over the airfoil. On the present 65A004 airfoil section the ice formations
on the upper surface extended only a very short distance from the zero-chord 
point, as indicated in table II. Consequently, for this airfoil
section, little variation in chordwise location of the significant ice
deposit occurred, and <strong>chordwise measurements of ice deposits were abandoned 
in favor of the ice angle θ</strong>. This angle, in conjunction with
h, thus determines the critical feature of an ice deposit with respect to
aerodynamic drag; also, θ provides a scale of measurement of the type of
ice (from rime to glaze).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Correlations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Correlation Between Ice Shape and Icing Conditions  </p>
<p>Ice angle. - In the data of table II, the ice angle θ increases
with increasing impingement rates and air temperatures and decreasing
angles of-attack. An empirical relation between these variables is shown
in figure 8 for the present airfoil data. The ice angle θ in the abscissa
of figure 8 is modified by the addition of the expression 58(1 - 1/1.35^αi) 
to account for the variation of 0 with the angle of attack αi.
The abscissa is thus a measurement of the type of ice formation, with a
value of 32 approximately dividing the observed rime ice from the glaze
ice. The ordinate of figure 8 is the expression w^0.5*(Em/(32-t_o)^(1/3) .
Although considerable scatter of data points exists, the exponents and
coefficients were each adjusted until an equal scattering of data about
an average straight line was obtained.
For the present data, air velocity had a negligible effect on 0,
and the best correlation was obtained with the velocity term absent. As
mentioned previously, the tunnel-cloud droplet size varied according to
the liquid-water content and velocity, and thus the effect on ice angle
of the droplet size as an independent variable was not obtainable.
However, the Em factor in the ordinate is sensitive to changes in drop
size, and the present conclusion is in substantial agreement with unpublished 
NACA flight data obtained for various ice formations on a 1/2-inch-diameter cylinder.
The expression resulting from the plot in figure 8 is as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>θ = 483 w^0.5 (Em/(32-t_o)^(1/3) - 72 - 58 (1 - 1/1.35^αi), deg   (1)

where 
w is liquid water content, g/m^3
Em is total droplet impingement efficiency
t_o is free-stream total temperature, F
αi is angle of attack during icing, degree
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, equation (1) relates the ice angle θ to the icing and operating
conditions that are generally known or calculable in a flight performance
study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 8" src="images/naca-tn-4151/Figure 8.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice height. - In a manner similar to that for the angle θ, the ice
height h was correlated with the various icing conditions, as shown in
figure 9. The relations shown in this figure yield the following
expression</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>h = 4.35X10-4 τ V_o (w β_m)*0.5 (32-t_o)^0.3   (2)

where 
τ is time in icing, minute
V_o is airspeed, mph
β_m is maximum local droplet efficiency
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="Figure 9" src="images/naca-tn-4151/Figure 9.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In equation (2) h varies approximately linearly with icing time
and velocity. figure 6 shows that the ice weight increased linearly with
time for rime icing conditions but exceeded a linear relation for glaze
icing conditions. These peculiarities may be explained by the geometry
of the ice shape. Whereas rime icing deposits tend to grow directly into
the airstream and thus form rectangular cross sections, glaze icing deposits
grow both forward and laterally, and resemble triangular (or trapezoidal)
cross sections with the base growing away from the airfoil. Thus, the
area of a rectangle (analogous to weight of rime ice) increases linearly
with its length (dimension h), while the area of a triangle (weight of
glaze ice) increases faster than its height, by virtue of the increasing
base. Therefore, the observed linear variation of ice height with time
(fig. 9) is not inconsistent with the trends of ice weight against time
(fig. 6).</p>
<p>The present measurements of airfoil ice formations were all obtained
on the 6-foot-chord airfoil, and consequently body size (or chord) was not
varied. However, the ice height correlation of eqiation (2) agrees
remarkably well with unpublished measurements obtained on the following
bodies: 0.8-inch-chord streamlined strut, 0.5-inch-diameter cylinder,
and 0.1-inch-diameter cylinder. As noted in the preceding section, the
ice-angle correlation also agreed with limited data obtained on a 1/2-
inch-diameter cylinder. These unpublished data substantiate the correlations 
given for ice height and angle, which should be valid over a
considerable range of body size and shape.</p>
<p>Correlation Between Ice Shape and Drag-Coefficient Changes<br>
Changes in airfoil drag coefficients due to protuberances are shown
in reference 10 to vary linearly with protuberance height-to-chord ratio
in most cases. As discussed previously, and in references 9 and 11,
changes in airfoil drag coefficients due to ice formations are also expected 
to vary almost linearly with some ratio of ice thickness to chord
(herein h/c). Consequently, a linear relation was assumed for simplicity,
and the change in drag coefficient due to ice (ΔCD) was divided by the
height-to-chord ratio h/c to remove the ice thickness variation from
the drag change and permit a study of the other variables. In figure 10
the term ΔCD/100h is plotted against the angle 0 for the airfoil
data in table II. The ordinate is the change in drag coefficient caused
by the various ice formations corrected to a common height equal to 1
percent of chord. These drag-coefficient changes are shown for each angle
of attack investigated.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 10" src="images/naca-tn-4151/Figure 10.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data scatter in figure 10 is again considerable, but mean curves
for each angle-of-attack condition are readily discernible. The trends
with respect to 0 and a are very pronounced. As discussed in refer-
ence 2, the airfoil drag coefficient is considerably reduced by the
addition of ice at the higher angles of attack and negative angles of 0.
For figure 10, the relations given in equations (1) and (2) were utilized
to determine U and h, respectively. Thus, as shown by the scale legends,
the terms U and h, which generally are unknown, are eliminated and
CD may be determined from known icing and operating conditions.</p>
<p>Final Correlation Between Drag-Coefficient Changes and Icing Conditions<br>
By use of figure 10 the changes in airfoil-section drag coefficients
due to ice formations may be determined from the icing and operating
conditions. These relations are shown for each of several angles of
attack. To obtain a complete relation, it is necessary to determine an
equation to account for the effects of angle of attack in figure 10. A
trigonometric equation form was selected to fit the curves in figure 10
for two reasons. First, the data fitted into curves suggestive of sine
functions somewhat better than into straight lines; and second, reasoning
as to the probable nature of the curves beyond the data limits indicated
that each curve would probably have a maximum and a minimum value as a
function of 0.</p>

<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
It should be noted that the preceding correlation is a first-order
approximation applicable to an unswept NACA 65A004 airfoil section, and
extension of the variables beyond the range of.present data might give
erroneous results. The present analysis shows primarily that correlations
between icing conditions, icing deposits, and aerodynamic drag characteristics 
are possible. For a correlation of similar data for a variety
of airfoils, the present equation would need additional variables to
account for airfoil shape.<br>
The present data correlation is influenced greatly by the thinness
of the airfoil, the pointed leading edge, and the flow separation from
the upper surface at high angles of attack. Thicker airfoils with blunt
leading edges would have few or no cases of drag reductions with ice,
and any correlation among ice shape, angle of attack, and change in drag
would probably be more orderly.<br>
The drag-coefficient changes due to ice formations are predicted by
the final equation virtually without limits (e.g., with very long icing
times). Realistically, however, drag increases are eventually limited by
presently unknown shedding characteristics of the ice, and drag reductions
are probably limited to values that yield section drag coefficients comparable 
to those of the lowest-drag airfoil sections known at the particular 
angle-of-attack condition.<br>
This correlation concerns only the changes in section drag coefficients; 
changes in lift and pitching-moment coefficients were not studied;
however, estimates of the lift and pitching-moment changes can be made
based on the trends in the aerodynamic data of NACA TN 4155. Also, a
similar analysis for lift and moment coefficient changes could probably
be made from the data of TN 4155.<br>
Several secondary factors were ignored in making the present analysis.
In reducing the ice shape to two dimensions, an angle and a height, the
following factors were unaccounted for: relative bluntness or sharpness of
the peak of the ice formation, chordwise location of the upper-surface edge
of the ice formation, and amount and location of lower-surface ice. These
factors all have noticeable effects on the aerodynamic data and would
undoubtedly reduce the data scatter if properly accounted for. However,
this correlation should be useful in estimating the effects of icing
encounters on various flight operations and missions. For these estimates,
direct and internally consistent calculations can be made with the final
equation derived in this report.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>NACA-TN-4155 Conclusion:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
A study of the effect of ice formations on the lift, drag, and
pitching-moment characteristics of an unswept NACA 65A004 airfoil determined 
the following principal results:<br>
1. The magnitude of the aerodynamic penalties was primarily a function 
of the shape and size of the ice formation near the leading edge of
the airfoil. The size and shape of the ice formation in turn was a
complex function of such variables as water content, droplet size, air
temperature, icing time, airfoil angle of attack, and airspeed. (Empirical
correlations among these variables, the ice shape, and aerodynamic drag
due to ice are given in TN 4151, based on the present data.)<br>
2. In general, icing of the airfoil at angles of attack less than
4° was detrimental to the aerodynamic characteristics. Icing caused
large increases in section drag coefficient (as much as 350 percent in
8 minutes of heavy glaze icing), reductions in section lift coefficients
(up to 13 percent), and changes in the pitching-moment coefficient from
diving toward climbing moments.<br>
3. At angles of attack greater than 4° the aerodynamic characteristics
of the airfoil were at times either penalized or improved by ice formations 
on the airfoil, depending mainly on whether the ice was glaze or
rime in character. In rime-icing conditions the section drag coefficient
was generally reduced by icing compared to that for the clean airfoil
(by as much as 45 percent in 8 minutes of icing). In glaze-icing conditions 
drag rises occurred at these higher angles of attack; however, the
lift also increased, as much as 9 percent for an icing time of 8 minutes.
Pitching-moment coefficients in icing conditions were somewhat erratic and
depended on the icing condition.<br>
4. Drag reductions due to, ice on this airfoil were possible because
at times the ice formations altered the aerodynamic shape sufficiently to
reduce the extent of upper-surface flow separation below the amount
present in clear air (beginning at an angle of attack near 4°). Lift increases 
due to ice were partly attributed to reductions in extent of
flow separation and partly to lift forces on the ice itself, which at
times was analogous to a leading-edge flap.  </p>

<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
From an analysis of impingement, ice deposits, and aerodynamic drag
for an unswept NACA 65A004 airfoil section exposed to icing conditions
in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel, the following principal results were
obtained:<br>
1. A general correlation was obtained relating the change in airfoil-section 
drag coefficient due to ice formations to the following icing
and operating conditions: icing time, airspeed, chord length, liquid-water 
content, cloud droplet impingement efficiencies, air total temperature, 
and airfoil angles of attack.<br>
2. It was found possible to relate changes in airfoil drag coefficients
to two significant measurements of the ice formations, a height dimension
and an ice angle.<br>
3. A variety of ice formations were photographed, weighed, cross-sectioned, 
measured, and correlated with the icing conditions in which
they were formed.<br>
4. Ice-formation weights increased at approximately constant rates
with increasing time in a rime icing condition and at progressively
increasing rates in glaze icing conditions. Initial rates of ice collection
agreed reasonably well with values predicted from droplet impingement data.<br>
5. Experimental droplet impingement rates on this airfoil section
agreed with previous theoretical calculations for angles of attack of
40 or less. Disagreement at higher angles of attack was attributed to
flow separation from the upper surface of the experimental airfoil model.<br>
6. An equation is derived that can be used in conjunction with
TN 4155 in estimating the effects of icing encounters on flight performance
for an NACA 65A004 airfoil section.  </p>

<p>We can see elements of a "freezing fraction" calculation from Messinger <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> in equations (1) and (2)
from above. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>θ = 483 w^0.5 (Em/(32-t_o)^(1/3) - 72 - 58 (1 - 1/1.35^αi), deg   (1)

h = 4.35X10-4 τ V_o (w β_m)*0.5 (32-t_o)^0.3   (2)
</code></pre></div>

<p>LWC (w) and a water catch efficient term (E_m or β_m) are in both, and a temperature difference. </p>
<p>From Messinger (equations re-arranged), we also see a water catch rate and a temperature difference:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mw = LWC * β * V_o  or mw = LWC * E_m / length * V_o

n = ((hc * (ts - ta)) + (Le * hc * 0.7 / cp * (pvs - pv) / p) + (mw * cpw * (ts - ta)) 
      -(hc * (r * u**2 / 2 / cp))-(mw * (u**2 / 2))) / (Lf * mw)
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, author Gray used dimensional values, not a dimensionless parameter, in his correlation. </p>
