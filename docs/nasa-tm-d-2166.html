<h1>SAE Preprint No. 225, "Correlation of Airfoil Ice Formations and Their Aerodynamic Effects With Impingement and Flight Conditions"</h1>
<p>and  </p>
<h1>NASA-TM-D-2166, "Prediction of Aerodynamic Penalties Caused by Ice Formations on Various Airfoils"</h1>
<p>The content of these two publications are almost identical. 
As NASA-TM-D-2166 is the one that was cited the most, 
and has a more legible copy available online, 
I will center the review around it. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A more general correlation of drag due to ice on an airfoil is developed.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Several airfoils are studied in addition to the NACA 65A004 previously used.  </li>
<li>A more general correlation of drag due to ice on an airfoil is developed.  </li>
<li>For lift, "no systematic relation is readily apparent for a thin, sharp-nosed airfoil
such as the 65A004 airfoil".  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An empirical equation is developed by which changes in drag coefficients due to ice formations
on an NACA 65A004 airfoil may be calculated from known icing and flight conditions;
this equation is then extended to include available data for other airfoils with thickness
ratios up to 15 percent.
The correlation was obtained primarily by use of ice heights and ice angles measured
on the 4-percent-thick airfoil.
The final equation, however, does not include the ice measurements, but relates
changes in drag coefficients due to ice with the following variables:
icing time, airspeed, air temperature, liquid-water content, 
cloud-droplet-impingement efficiencies, airfoil chord, angles of attack,
and leading-edge radius of curvature.  </p>
<p>Changes in lift and pitching-moment
coefficients due to ice on an NACA 0011 airfoil
are also related to the corresponding changes
in drag coefficients;
additional data on lift and pitching-moment changes
due to ice are limited to the 65A004 airfoil,
for which complex trends preclude a general relation scope of this report.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>NASA-TM-D-2166 was published (in 1964) after the end of the NACA-era. 
However, it is listed in the <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">"Selected Bibilography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications"</a>.  </p>
<p>A footnote in NASA-TM-D-2166 explains the republication of the data from SAE Preprint 225: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The material contained herein was presented as a paper at the 
SAE National Aeronautic Meeting, 
Los Angeles, California, October 4, 1957, 
under the title "Correlation of Airfoil Ice Formations and Their Aerodynamic 
Effects with Impingement and Flight Conditions." 
It is now being published because of present interest in icing protection 
for light aircraft (CAR-3) and helicopters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Readers may also note some material reused from <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/naca-tn-4151.html">NACA-TN-4151 and NACA-TN-4155</a>,
which were reviewed previously, and that material will not be repeated here. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A review of the aerodynamic data from these previous icing studies showed
that, to understand the effects of ice on airfoil characteristics,
it would be
necessary to study the exact ice shapes and sizes and to relate the aerodynamic
effect of the ice to the known effects produced by surface roughness, flow
spoilers, leading-edge flaps, etc., which ice simulates. 
Such a study was accomplished with icing data for the NACA 65A004 airfoil
section shown in figure 1 (ref. 5). 
In this study, a variety of ice shapes was accurately measured and related 
to the generating impingement and icing conditions. 
The changes in airfoil
drag coefficients due to ice were then correlated with the ice shapes and, 
finally, with impingement and flight conditions. 
The object of this report is to
describe this analysis of icing data for the 4-percent-thick airfoil
and to extend it to include all the airfoil
sections for which aerodynamic data in NACA
icing tunnel conditions are available.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PREDICTION OF DRAG CHANGES DUE TO ICE ON VARIOUS AIRFOILS<br>
Because equation (1) for approximating the drag-coefficient
changes due to ice on an NACA 65A004 airfoil was determined, 
it was desirable to attempt a similar relation for other airfoils,
although ice measurements were available only
for the 4-percent-thick airfoil.
Accordingly, all the applicable NACA icing drag
data from references 2 to 4 were inserted into equation (1) for trial,
and impingement parameters were interpolated from data of reference 6. 
These icing data are listed in table I. It was found that an airfoil
thickness trend appeared; 
to account for this trend, a factor r was introduced, which is the airfoil 
leading-edge radius of curvature in percent of chord. 
Also, in the absence
of more knowledge as to the effect of sweep on drag due to ice formations, the
63A009 airfoil
(sweep angle, 36°) was regarded for correlation purposes as an unswept 
two-dimensional airfoil,
except that impingement, chord length, and radius
of curvature were taken for the stream wise cross section of the airfoil.  </p>

<p><img alt="Equation 1" src="images/nasa-d-2166/Equation 1.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A final equation was derived that represents the available icing drag data
of the referenced airfoils
and that is consistent with equation (1) for the
4-percent-thick airfoil:  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Equation 2" src="images/nasa-d-2166/Equation 2.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measured values of ΔCd from table I and reference 5 are plotted in figure 7 
against the values calculated by using equation (2). 
The order of agreement shown in figure 7 appears quite satisfactory, 
considering the nature and difficulty of obtaining aerodynamic, impingement, 
and meteorological data in icing conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 7" src="images/nasa-d-2166/Figure 7.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, changes in lift
and pitching-moment coefficients due to ice
formations are known only for NACA0011 (ref. 3) and 65A004 (ref. i) airfoils.
In addition to these data, however, it should be possible to estimate changes in
lift and moment coefficients by utilizing
relations in the published aerodynamic characteristics
of airfoils with and without flaps, spoilers, protuberances, etc.  </p>
<p>From the limited data available in icing conditions, it appears that changes
in lift
and moment coefficients due to ice formations can be related to the 
concurrent changes in drag coefficients for a thick, blunt airfoil
such as the 0011 airfoil,
whereas no systematic relation is readily apparent for a thin, sharp-nosed airfoil
such as the 65A004 airfoil.
The relations between changes in lift,
moment, and drag coefficients due to ice on the 0011 airfoil
are shown in figure 8 as functions of geometric angle of attack (data of ref. 3). 
Well-established trends are evident in figure 8, 
wherein increases in drag coefficients are accompanied 
by similar increases in moment coefficients and by decreases in lift
coefficients of generally larger magnitude. These trends are
similar to the trends with the 65A004 airfoil,
but only up to angles of attack of
about 3°. At higher angles of attack, changes in lift and moment coefficients
due to ice on the 4-percent-thick airfoil
were erratic with respect to changes in
drag coefficients,
primarily because of the flow separation from the upper surface 
starting at an angle of attack of about 4° (ref. 1).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted in conclusion that this correlation 
is a first-order approximation 
of the presently available aerodynamic and icing data 
for airfoils exposed to icing conditions in the NACA icing tunnel. 
Several factors that were thought to be secondary in importance were ignored in this analysis. 
The correlation should be useful, however, 
in estimating the type and size of ice formations that would result from any specified icing encounter, 
in estimating the aerodynamic penalties that would result from an encounter, 
and in making flight performance studies in which icing effects must be evaluated.</p>
