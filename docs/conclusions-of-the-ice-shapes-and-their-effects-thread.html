<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<p>We will look at recent data to address some questions:<br>
1. Does leading edge freezing fraction correlate to airfoil ice shape parameters?<br>
2. How well do LEWICE results compare to the ice shape drag data?  </p>
<h3>Correlation to freezing fraction</h3>
<h4>NACA-TN-4151</h4>
<p>In the review of NACA-TN-4155, it was noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, equation (1) relates the ice angle θ to the icing and operating
conditions that are generally known or calculable in a flight performance
study.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>θ = 483 w^0.5 (E_m/(32-t_o)^(1/3) - 72 - 58 (1 - 1/1.35^αi), deg   (1)

h = 4.35X10-4 τ V_o (w β_m)*0.5 (32-t_o)^0.3   (2)
</code></pre></div>

<p>LWC (w) and a water catch efficient term (E_m or β_m) are in both, and a temperature difference. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 7 from NACA-TN-4151" src="images/naca-tn-4151/Figure 7.png"><br>
<em>Figure 7 from NACA-TN-4151</em> </p>
<p>We can see elements of a "freezing fraction" calculation from Messinger <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> in equations (1) and (2)
from above. </p>
<p>From Messinger (equations re-arranged), we also see a water catch rate and a temperature difference:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mw = LWC * β * V_o  or mw = LWC * E_m / length * V_o

n = ((hc * (ts - ta)) + (Le * hc * 0.7 / cp * (pvs - pv) / p) + (mw * cpw * (ts - ta)) 
      -(hc * (r * u**2 / 2 / cp))-(mw * (u**2 / 2))) / (Lf * mw)
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/conclusions-of-the-icing-thermodynamics-thread.html">Conclusions of the Icing Thermodynamics Thread</a> 
it was noted that 
<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20050215212/downloads/20050215212.pdf">NASA/CR-2005-213852</a><br>
treated the airfoil leading edge as a cylinder with a diameter equal to twice the leading edge radius of curvature 
for calculating leading edge freezing fraction. 
We will use that here. </p>
<p>For the cases in NACA-TN-4151 Table II, 
the leading edge equivalent cylinder freezing fractions were calculated. 
A Langmuir "D" drop size distribution was assumed. </p>
<p>A fitting function of the form </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A * freezing_fraction + B * aoa + C = theta_upper_horn_measured
</code></pre></div>

<p>was used to determine the best fit coefficient values of A and B and C. </p>
<p>The results of this are compared to the values from equation (1) below:  </p>
<p><img alt="calculated fit of theta values" src="images/ice_shapes_wrap_up/thetas fits.png">  </p>
<p>Both fits have some variance, but the one using freezing fraction 
has a better fit. </p>
<p>A similar fit was made for ice height with the addition 
of a water catch term:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A * freezing_fraction * water_catch + B * aoa + C = theta_upper_horn_measured
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="calculated fit of ice heights" src="images/ice_shapes_wrap_up/ffcyl hs fit.png">  </p>
<p>The results are comparable between equation (2) values 
and the fit with freezing fraction. </p>
<p>To summarized, calculated equivalent cylinder leading edge freezing fraction 
correlates as well to the ice shape height and theta as 
the icing conditions equations (1) and (2). 
They convey very similar information. </p>
<p>I view this as further validation of Uwe von Glahn's assertion that 
<strong>"The collection of ice by the cylinders is similar to the collection of ice by airplane components"</strong> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> from 1955.  </p>
<h4>AEDC-TR-87-23 <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></h4>
<p>AEDC-TR-87-23 (which we will review in more detail in the upcoming <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html">Icing Wind Tunnels Test Thread</a>) 
used the drag coefficient Cd as an ice shape similarity indicator
(and skipped over the ice shape details):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>drag coefficient (Cd) was used as an index of similitude by quantitatively indicating how much the shape or ice surface changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It found that calculated leading edge freezing fraction corresponds
to Cd measured with an ice shape, in a complex way, 
with ice shapes having a calculated leading edge freezing fraction of about 0.3
having the highest drag coefficient.   </p>
<p><img alt="AEDC-TR-87-23 Figure 8" src="images/aedc_tr_87_23/Figure 8.png">  </p>
<p>While AEDC-TR-87-23 did not include this, there is correspondence
between calculated leading edge freezing fraction and ice horn angle for the 
NACA0012 airfoil used in the study:</p>
<p><img alt="Calculated fit of n to theta" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_no_theta.png">  </p>
<p>This suggests that calculated leading edge freezing fraction is not 
only an indicator of ice shape factors, but it also indicates the 
aerodynamic effect of drag due to an ice shape, 
and that the corresponding shape factors (location and height of the ice horn)
are aerodynamically meaningful.</p>
<h3>Comparison of NASA-TM-83556 <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> to LEWICE2D <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> and <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/naca-tr-446.html">NACA-TR-446</a></h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/conclusions-of-the-cylinder-thread.html">Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread</a> 
and <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/conclusions-of-the-icing-thermodynamics-thread.html">Conclusions of the Icing Thermodynamics Thread</a> 
comparisons to LEWICE 2D were made. </p>
<p>We will do so again here, using data from NASA-TM-83556 where 
the drag due to ice shapes was measured. 
(We will review this data in more detail in the upcoming <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html">Icing Wind Tunnels Test Thread</a>).
Fortunately, a NACA0012 airfoil was used, as was used in NACA-TR-446. 
There is a fair chord Reynolds number match between this (2.2 to 3.6 x10^6) and NACA-TR-446 (3.1 x10^6).
The data is at an angle of attack of 4 degrees,
while the NACA-TR-446 data is at Cl=0.5, which is at approximately 4 degrees angle of attack.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10 from NASA-TM-83556" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/Figure 10.png"><br>
<em>Figure 10 from NASA-TM-83556</em> </p>
<p>A Langmuir "D" drop size distribution was used for LEWICE 2D analysis of the conditions in Figure 10.
LEWICE 2D yields similar, but not identical, ice shapes. 
In general, the LEWICE shapes are thinner (due in part to being run with the default ice density of 917 kg/m^2),
and the ice horn angles are larger. </p>
<p><img alt="LEWICE calculations for Figure 10 data" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_fig10_1_lewice.png"><br>
<img alt="LEWICE calculations for Figure 10 data" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_fig10_2_lewice.png">  </p>
<p>LEWICE 2D does not have a way to evaluate drag due to ice 
and the calculation of drag due to ice is challenging for any CFD method, 
particularly for glaze ice cases at higher angle of attack values 
and higher Reynolds number values, where modeling separated flow is an important factor
(and I have seen far too many simulations stop well short of Cl_max). </p>
<p>To crudely estimate the effects of the LEWICE ice shapes, 
we will try using NACA-TR-446 data. 
A challenge is that the NACA-TR-446 data is only available at certain 
protuberance heights and x/c stations. 
The largest height/chord ratio in the NACA-TR-446 values is 0.0125, 
but the ice horn heights are in the 0.03 to 0.08 range. 
The closest stations of interest are at x/c=0 and x/c=0.05, 
while the ice horn bases are at values of x/c &lt; 0.005. 
This is pushing <em>"discriminating use of the data"</em> <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> to its limits.
The measured ice data only roughly corresponds to the protuberance data: </p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of NASA-TM-83556 data to NACA-TR-446" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_xc_delta_cd_normalized.png">  </p>
<p>we will also use a fit of delta Cd due to ice with ice horn angle and ice height,
and allow extrapolation to larger horn angles (this is a subset of the data in AEDC-TR-87-23).  </p>
<p><img alt="Fit of NASA-TM-83556 data" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_theta_delta_cd_normalized.png">  </p>
<p>(A comparison to NASA-TM-D-2166 <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> methods were discussed in the review of <a href="{}NASA-TM-D-2166.md">NASA-TM-D-2166</a>,
and were found to be of limited accuracy.)</p>
<p>With either of the very approximate extrapolation of Cd, 
the estimated effects are different than Figure 10 (b) from above. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 10b from NASA-TM-83556" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/Figure 10b.png"></p>
<p><img alt="Calculated Cd values for figure 10 conditions" src="images/nasa-tm-83556/nasa_tm_83556_lewice_comparison_extrapolated_cd.png">  </p>
<p>With the NACA-TR-446 based extrapolation, the 338 km/h case at -2C is correctly identified 
as the case with the largest effect, but the other values do not match Figure 10 (b) well. </p>
<p>The method using a fit of NASA-TM-83556 horn angle data did not correctly identify the condition with the largest section drag coefficient,
though at least the highest Cd test condition was a close second in the analysis. 
In general, values do not match Figure 10 (b) well. 
I suppose that "first-order approximation" (a phrase from NASA-TM-D-2166) applies as a description. </p>
<p>Note that these results were for a moderate chord (0.53 m) airfoil. 
Results may be different for a larger or smaller airfoil in
similar icing conditions. </p>
<p>It is not clear to me if the limited accuracy of the effect extrapolation methods used here
make the LEWICE ice shapes effects seem to be significantly different when they may not really be, 
or if the LEWICE ice shapes themselves are meaningfully different. </p>
<p>As I have often seen in icing publications, 
a phrase like <strong>"Additional work is needed"</strong> <sup id="fnref2:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> applies here.</p>
<p>Additional work is ongoing in groups such as the 
AIAA Ice Prediction Workshop Workshop <sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>. 
While the ice shape results above were specifically for LEWICE2D, 
I am not sure that any other currently available code 
that was presented at the workshop so far
would produce significantly better results. 
The workshop has not gotten to ice shape effects yet. </p>
<p>We also have not discussed lift effects much. 
NASA-TM-D-2166 stated that "no systematic relation is readily apparent for a thin, sharp-nosed airfoil such as the 65A004 airfoil", 
and there are fewer measurements of lift effects of in the NACA literature than for drag effects. 
The lift effects of leading edge ice tend to be small for "typical" angle of attack values, 
but can become significant at higher angle of attack values approaching the clean airfoil Cl_max. 
Drag has been referred to as a "leading indicator" of lift effects, 
as the change in drag due to ice a low angles of attack can be measurably significant, 
while the lift effects may not be apparent until higher angle of attack are reached. </p>
<p>At the moment, if one needs accurate data for effects due to ice, 
a combination of icing wind tunnel test, wind tunnel test, and
perhaps flight test are recommended, similar to the methods used in 1969 
[see <a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/the-greatest-thing-that-you-have-probably-never-read-1969-aircraft-ice-protection-report-of-symposium-ramon-wilder-1.html">Wilder, Ramon W.: "Techniques used to determine Artificial Ice Shapes and Ice Shedding, Characteristics of Unprotected Airfoil Surfaces"</a>]. </p>
<h2>What is still used today</h2>
<h3>Protuberance effects</h3>
<p>The "protuberance" effect data from NACA-TR-446 in perpetuated in Brumby <sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>,
which in addition to NACA-TR-446 collected several other studies and 
summarized them on a series of graphs. </p>
<p>These are still used today for purposes like in NACA-TR-446 of
"the prediction of the effects of short span protuberances" 
such as spoilers, and the effect of repairs such as external doublers. </p>
<p>Protuberances have had renewed interest after supercooled large drop (SLD) icing 
was recognized as a potential threat to current aircraft. 
Large drop icing can form in area different from smaller drops, 
and if ice forms aft of a protection system it can produce different shapes. 
The "Forward Facing Quarter Round" has been used to represent such ice. </p>

<h3>Icing conditions parameters</h3>
<p>As we saw above, the "empirical" icing conditions parameters in NACA-TN-4151 
anticipated and correlate to equivalent leading edge freezing fraction values. </p>
<p>This gets used in NASA/CR-2004-212875 <sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> and NASA/CR-2005-213852 <sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup>.  </p>

<p>Figure 3 from NASA/CR-2005-213852.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Ice shape parameters</h3>
<p>While there is no completely agreed upon "standard" set of parameters to describe an ice shape, 
the values from NACA-TN-4151 Figure 7 get perpetuated in the LEWICE user's manual <sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup>
(although the theta=0 reference is shifted),
and these (with the addition of icing limits) are probably the closest thing we have to a "standard" set,
at least for 2D characterizations (3D is a matter of ongoing research):  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 18 Ice shape parameters from LEWICE manual" src="images/ice_shapes_wrap_up/LEWICE manual figure 18.png">  </p>
<p>However, the validation report <sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> used a modified definition for theta:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 16 from NASA/CR-1998-208687" src="images/ice_shapes_wrap_up/LEWICE validation fig 16.png">  </p>
