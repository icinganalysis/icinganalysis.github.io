<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the temperature 
profiles downstream of heated air jets directed at angles of
90°, 60°, 45°, and 30° to an air stream. The profiles were determined
at two positions downstream of the jet as a function of jet diameter,
jet density, jet velocity, free-stream density, free-stream velocity,
jet total temperature, orifice flow coefficient, and jet angle. A
method is presented which yields a good approximation of the temperature 
profile in terms of the flow and geometric conditions.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The discharging of heated high-velocity jets of air or vapor into
an air stream is employed in many installations either as a means of
heating the air stream or as a method of disposing of hot discharge
gases; For practical application, however, the discharging of heated
jets into an air stream requires knowledge of the temperature profiles
downstream of the heated jet and of the depth of penetration of the jet
into the air stream.</p>
<p>Heating an air stream by means of heated air jets directed perpendicularly 
to the air stream has been previously reported in references 
1 and 2. A method is presented in reference 1 by which the temperature 
profile and the depth of penetration of a circular heated air
jet directed perpendicularly to the air stream may be predicted at any
point downstream of the jet.  </p>
<p>Because many installations employ jets which are directed at an
angle other than 90° to the airstream, a study of the temperature profiles 
downstream of circular heated air jets directed at various angles
to the air stream was conducted in the 2- by 20-inch tunnel at the NACA
Lewis laboratory. Sixteen heated air jets were investigated for a range
of free-stream velocities, jet total temperatures, jet total pressures,
and jet angles. The 16 jets investigated comprised a group of basic
jets with four diameters and each diameter was investigated for four
jet angles.  </p>
<p>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE </p>
<p>A sketch showing the experimental arrangement used in the investigation 
to determine the temperature profile downstream of a heated air
jet issuing at various angles to an air stream is shown in figure 1(a).
Heated air for the jets was obtained by passing high-pressure air
through electric heaters and into a plenum chamber, the upper portion
of which contained the orifice blocks. The rate of jet-air flow was
measured by means of calibrated orifices located upstream of the electric 
heaters. Each of the 16 jet orifices was investigated for a range
of jet pressure ratios (ratio of jet total pressure measured at exit to
outlet static pressure) from 1.2 to 3.5. The jet total pressure was
measured by means of a pressure tap located in the wall of the plenum
chamber and was corrected for total pressure loss through the flow
passages. (Bench tests were conducted to determine the pressure loss
through the passages under choked-flow condition In still air.) The
jet total temperatures and free-stream velocities investigated were
nearly constant values of 660° and 860° F, and 235 and 400 feet per
second, respectively. The temperature profiles were measured by means
of a movable thermocouple rake which consisted of 33 thermocouple
probes spaced 0.250 inch apart. The thermocouple rake was inserted at
positions 6.47 and 18.0 inches downstream of the discharge-orifice
center.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The orifices used in the investigation consisted of smooth circular
holes machined in cast Inconel orifice blocks as shown in figure 1(b).
The orifice holes were 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, and 0.625 inch in diameter
and each orifice was investigated at jet angles
of 90°, 60°, 45°, and 30° to the air stream. Although the holes are circular in cross
section, the plan form of the orifices (jet exit) is elliptical in a
plane parallel to the main stream except for the cases where the jet
angle 3 is 90°. The orifice blocks were so machined that the center
line of the 16 orifices investigated passed through the same point at
the surface of the model. The length of the passage through the various
orifice blocks varied in length from 2.0 inches for jets issuing at 90°
to the air stream to 4.0 inches for the jets discharging at 30° to the
main tunnel flow. The term "orifice diameter" or "jet diameter" is
used throughout this report when referring to the diameter of the discharge 
opening measured perpendicular to the jet axis (fig. 1(b)).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a study of the data for jets issuing at angles of 60°, 45°, and
30° to the air stream, it was found that in most instances, the general
shape of the temperature profiles differed greatly from that obtained
for a jet discharging at an angle of 90° (fig. 2(a)). However, the
study also showed that these various types at profile had certain consistent 
characteristics similar to those noted for a jet discharging at
900 to the air stream. It was found that four basic types of temperature 
profile, measured downstream of the jets, could be used to represent 
the profile data for all jet diameters and jet angles investigated
(fig. 2). Also shown in figure 2 is the manner in which these profiles
are approximated by straight lines.</p>

<p>RESULTS MID DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Flow Coefficient</p>
<p>The discharge-orifice flow coefficient C is defined as the ratio
of the actual measured mass flow to-the theoretical mass flow. The
actual mass flow through the various discharge orifices was measured by
means of calibrated measuring orifices located upstream of the electric
heaters. The theoretical mass flow was calculated from the compressible
flow relations based on conditions at the jet exit. (Bench tests were
made to determine the pressure loss through the jet flow passages under
choked flow conditions.) The total-temperature loss through the jet
flow passages was found to have a negligible effect on the flow coefficient
(less than 0.5 percent). As expected, the measured flow coefficient 
for all the jets investigated was found to be independent of jet
pressure ratio at values greater than choking. The flow coefficient
ranged from 0.88 to 0.92 for all jets investigated and the arithmetic
average was 0.90. Because the measured flow coefficients obtained for
the orifices used in this investigation may not be applicable for other
installations, no data for the flOw coefficients are presented in this
report.  </p>
<p>Correlation of Penetration Coefficient X1 C^0.5 Dj</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The over-all parameter obtained for correlation of the penetration
coefficient X1 C^0.5 Dj for a jet issuing at 60° to the air stream was
found to be φ2 (ρj/ρo)^0.49 (Vj/Vo)^0.49 (s C^0.5 Dj)^0.25 . 
The linear variation of the penetration coefficient with this parameter is 
shown in figure 5 for all values of orifice-diameter, mixing distances, 
free-stream velocities, and temperature ratios investigated. The 
density-ratio exponent, the velocity-ratio exponent; and the ratio of 
mixing distance to effective diameter exponent were found to remain constant
for all orifice diameters or width coefficients investigated. The
variation of the correlation parameter 2 with width coefficient
w/Dj is shown in figure 6 for constant values of temperature ratio.  </p>

<p>Comparison of Calculated and Experimental Profiles  </p>
<p>The correlation of the various coefficients 'with the flow and
geometric parameters presented in the foregoing discussion provides a
method by which an approximation of the temperature profile downstream
of a heated-air jet directed at an angle to the air stream may be
obtained.  </p>
<p>Based on the experimental conditions, a number of profiles were
calculated and compared with the actual profiles. Some typical -
examples are shown in figure 30. A study of this figure shows that,
in general, the approximate solution is in good agreement with the
experimental data and provides a reasonably simple method for obtaining
the temperature profile downstream of a heated-air jet directed at an
angle to the air stream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>efore calculating the various parameters needed for obtaining the
temperature profiles, it is necessary to first determine the proper 
jet-width coefficient at the mixing distance in question. If, for the
problem being considered, the jet is discharging into an unbounded air
stream, the jet is unrestricted, and the width coefficient has but one
possible value for a given s/D (fig. 32). If the jet being considered is 
discharging into a duct, the proper width coefficient to
use in calculations is dependent on whether or not the jet is restricted.
If the jet-width coefficient as determined from figure 32 is greater
than the duct-width coefficient, the jet is restricted in its expansion
and the duct-width coefficient is the important parameter. If the jet-width 
coefficient is less than the duct-width coefficient, the jet is
relatively unrestricted and the jet-width coefficient becomes the
important parameter and should be used in the calculations.  </p>
<p>COMPARISON OF CALCULATED MID EXPERIMENTAL JET BOUTIDARIES  </p>
<p>During the course of the investigation, numerous photographs of
the jet boundary were made by means of the Schlieren technique and the
results were compared with the calculated jet boundary obtained by use
of the correlation curves presented herein. For illustrative purposes,
the calculated boundaries were obtained from both a constant value of
width coefficient based on tunnel dimensions and a variable jet-width
coefficient based on the actual width of the jet at the point of
interest (fig. 32).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some typical examples of the comparisons obtained
are shown in figure 33 for the four jet angles investigated. The distance 
normal to the model surface is shown plotted against the mixing
distance. A study of this figure shows that use of the width coefficient 
based on the actual jet width yields calculated profiles which
are in reasonably good agreement with the measured profile obtained
from Schlieren photographs. The use of a constant width coefficient,
based on tunnel dimensions, yields calculated profiles which deviate
considerably from the actual profile for small values of mixing distance 
where the jet is not confined by the tunnel walls. The value of
mixing distance at which the two calculated curves become one curve is
the point beyond which the jet becomes confined by the walls of the
tunnel.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A study of the Schlieren photographs also shows that the lower jet
boundary leaves the surface of the model before sufficient expansion
and mixing of the jet with the air stream takes place to enable the jet
to contact the surface. The surface distance downstream of the orifice
which is unheated by the jet increases with decreasing jet angle for
the range of jet angle investigated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A method which provides a reasonably simple means of obtaining the
approximate temperature profile downstream of a heated-air jet directed
at an angle to the air stream has been presented in terms of dimensionless 
parameters of the flow and geometric conditions.  </p>
