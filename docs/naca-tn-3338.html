<h1>"A Dye-Tracer Technique for Experimentally Obtaining Impingement Characteristics of Arbitrary Bodies and a Method for Determining Droplet Size Distribution" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A pioneering test method is described, and a drop size measurement analysis is proposed.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>A dye-tracer blotter-paper water drop impingement measurement technique is described. </li>
<li>An analysis of test results to determine the water spray drop size distribution is described. </li>
<li>The analysis method accuracy is unknown due to the lack of an independent measurement of drop sizes.</li>
<li>We see the use of the Icing Research Tunnel for the first time in the Cylinders thread.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A dye-tracer technique has been developed whereby the quantity of
dyed water collected on a blotter-wrapped body exposed to an air stream
containing a dyed-water spray cloud can be colorimetrically determined
in order to obtain local collection efficiencies, total collection 
efficiency, and rearward extent of impingement on the body. In addition, a
method has been developed whereby the impingement characteristics obtained 
experimentally for a body can be related to theoretical impingement data 
for the same body in order to determine the droplet size 
distribution of the impinging cloud. Several cylinders, a ribbon, and an
aspirating device to measure cloud liquid-water content were used in the
studies presented herein for the purpose of evaluating the dye-tracer
technique. Although the experimental techniques used in the dye-tracer
technique require careful control, the methods presented herein should be
applicable for any wind tunnel provided the humidity of the air stream
can be maintained near saturation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>The spray system</h3>
<p>There is a detailed discussion of a dye and blotter paper method of experimentally 
determining water drop impingement rates.  </p>
<p>The (then) NACA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) (now NASA Glenn) was used in the test. 
Cylinder test articles were constructed. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9. Typical installation of cylinder (4-inch diameter), 
with blotter paper attached, in 6- by 9-foot test section of 
icing research tunnel (looking downstream)." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure9.png">  </p>
<p>After the blotter paper was exposed to water spray with dye in it, the paper was analyzed for dye concentration. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 12. Typical blotter record from cylinder with punched segments removed for 
colormetric analysis after exposure to dyed-water cloud." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure12.png">  </p>
<p>Special nozzles with fast acting solenoids were used, but the spray part was the same as the usual IRT nozzles. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>These nozzles are of the same design as those used
in the main icing spray system of the icing tunnel and are located in
the same low-air-velocity section of the tunnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 11. Cross section of air-water atomizing nozzle assembly." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure11.png">  </p>
<h3>The impingement data</h3>
<p>After a chemical analysis of the dye concentration in the blotter paper 
the local water catch rates were calculated. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 20. Experimental local water impingement rates for three cylinder sizes. 
Airspeed, 175 miles per hour." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure20.png">  </p>
<h3>The distribution analysis</h3>
<p>The impingement is divided into arbitrary segments, 
and beta curves corresponding to drop sizes for the impingement limit are 
constricted and summed to yield an approximate total beta curve. 
Fractions of total water content for each segment are determined during the process. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 17. Typical experimental impingement rate for 
cylinder showing arbitrary increments of central 
angle theta and including contributions of several 
droplet size groups." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure17.png">  </p>
<p>The values from each group or segment are plotted, 
and a "faired" curve through them is manually produced. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 18. Block- and faired-type droplet size distributions as specified 
by limit of impingement theta_m on cylinder and cumulative liquid-water content w.
" src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure18.png">  </p>
<p>The cylinder angle theta values can be translated into drop impingement limits and plotted. 
(Note that drop radius "a" is used here, not diameter) </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 21. Droplet size distribution obtained from experimental impingement rates 
on cylinders (based on theoretical trajectories from reference 1)." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure21.png">  </p>
<p>It is not surprising that the curves tend to flat-line at low drop sizes. 
The drop radii for K=0.125, where impingement would be zero, are noted on the figure as "ac".</p>
<p>The analysis was also conducted using data from Langmuir and Blodgett,
shown in Figure 22 below. 
It is not clear how this was done, as Langmuir and Blodgett did not provide beta curves. 
I speculate that the Langmuir and Blodgett Em and Theta_max values were used with an
assumed cosine relationship as in NACA-TN-2904 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Beta=pi/2*Em/Theta_m*cos(pi/2*Theta/Theta_m)" src="images/naca-tn-2904/beta_cos.png"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 22. Droplet size distribution obtained from experimental impingement rates 
on cylinders (based on theoretical trajectories from reference 2)." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure22.png">  </p>
<p>The results from Figure 22 were set aside in favor of the NACA-TN-2904 method results from Figure 21.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The differences noted (between
figs. 21 and 22) are again caused by the differences inherent in the
theoretical results of references 1 and 2. Because more data points
are presented and the accuracy of the data is stated, reference 1 will
be used hereinafter rather than reference 2 as a basis for the 
subsequent results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flat results for small drop sizes in Figure 21 led to a re-evaluation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In obtaining a single curve which is the best representation of
the actual droplet size distribution existing in the tunnel for a given
set of spray conditions, it is reasonable to use an average of the nine
curves (three repeats times three cylinder sizes) in the larger droplet
size range where the results from all three cylinder sizes are in
reasonable agreement. In the range of the smaller droplet sizes (a &lt; 6
microns, see fig. 21), it appears that the theoretical data are not
strictly applicable because a different droplet size distribution curve
is obtained for each cylinder size. However, the end point of the droplet 
size distribution curve (a = 0, w = wt) is single-valued and is
specified by the wt values obtained with the aspirating device. The
averages (for several repeats) of the total liquid-water content wt
obtained with the aspirator are summarized as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="LWC Table from page 24" src="images/naca-tn-3338/LWC_table_page_24.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the cylinder-size trend for droplet radii less than 
approximately 6 microns (fig. 21), a straight line was faired between at 6
microns and the tabulated value of wt for each pressure ratio. The
results of this interpretation of the data are shown in figure 23; the
reasoning underlying this interpretation is presented in the DISCUSSION
section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 23. Final evaluation of droplet size distribution for three spray 
conditions based on experimental impingement rates of cylinders and an 
aspirating device (based on theoretical trajectories from reference 1)." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure23.png">  </p>
<h3>Need an independent measurement of drop sizes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The accuracy of determining droplet size distribution by the use of
the dye-tracer technique together with theoretical trajectory data could
be definitely established if an accurate instrument were available to
measure directly a representative sample of all droplet sizes present in
the experimental spray cloud. The present state of development of the
camera (ref. 16) or the oiled-slide technique (ref. 17) for measuring
droplet size is not considered so adequate a means for determining droplet 
size as the indirect method herein described.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot know the accuracy of the method with the data in NACA-TN-3338, 
as there was not an independent measurement of the drop size distribution. 
Figure 23 frankly does not look like a natural or artificially produced drop size spectrum that I have seen 
(they usually have an "S" shape, not a steep slope at one end), 
but perhaps the nozzles used in the test produced that size characteristic. 
I think that it is more likely that the aspirating device used to measure LWC was not very accurate, 
resulting in an artificially high left end point.</p>
<p>I think that here NACA-TN-3338 missed an opportunity. 
The oiled-slide measurement technique was studied in detail by Langmuir <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, 
and the potential shortcoming of the method noted. 
However, the technique can yield accurate results, 
if care is taken in both the sample collection and the processing of the samples. 
[I have used the oiled-slide method and other drop sizing instruments in natural icing flight tests].  </p>
<p>Langmuir chose to use oiled-slide data to develop the Langmuir distributions,
see <a href="/a-langmuir-b-drop-size-distribution-is-almost-a-normal-distribution.html">"A Langmuir B drop size distribution is (almost) a normal distribution"</a>.<br>
And NACA-TN-3338 also chose to make comparisons to a Langmuir distribution. </p>
<h3>Icing Research Tunnel</h3>
<p>I note how casually the (then) NACA Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) is mentioned (now the NASA Glenn IRT). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experimental studies of droplet
impingement characteristics on cylinders were conducted in the 6- by
9-foot-test section of the NACA icing tunnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no citation for the tunnel and its capabilities. 
(In contrast, there are at several publications in the calibration of the IRT). 
The ASME recognized the IRT as an "International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark" in 1987 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. 
Readers may be interested in 
<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a>.</p>
<p>The drop measurement technique described here may not be completely useful for the calibration of the IRT, 
as even if the spray parts of the nozzles were similar, 
installation details can cause differences in the spray cloud. 
And NACA-TN-3338 reported three candidate distributions, without data to select which is the best one.</p>
<p>The IRT merits further review (see the <a href="/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html">Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread</a>). 
For now, I will note that calibration of the tunnel in the NACA era was a challenge, 
in part due to limited instrumentation.
Author von Glahn of NACA-TN-3338 was an author of NACA-RM-E51B12 <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, which noted the use of multicylinders 
in the calibration of the icing tunnel: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud droplet sizes and liquid-water contents in the tunnel
were measured by the rotating-multicylinder method and were in the
range of natural icing conditions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast that to the detail in a post-NACA calibration of the IRT <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.  </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A technique for experimentally determining the impingement 
characteristics of an arbitrary body and a method whereby the droplet size
spectrum of the spray cloud can be determined from the experimental 
impingement on a body for which the theoretical trajectories are known
have been developed. These developments present an opportunity to study
experimentally the impingement characteristics of other shapes such as
airfoils, radomes, inlet cowlings, and asymmetrical bodies. Although
analytical trajectory studies can be made for these various bodies, the
problems associated with the determination of the flow fields and 
consequent droplet trajectories often prove difficult and tedious. Use of
the dye-tracer technique for arbitrary shapes in any suitable testing
facility would proceed as described herein for cylinders: The droplet
size distribution in the spray cloud would be established using bodies
for which the theoretical impingement characteristics are known, while
an aspirating device similar to the one described (appendix B) may be
used for the determination of total liquid-water content. The unknown
body with blotter then would be exposed and analyzed for local rates of
water impingement, including the determination of the maximum extent or
limit of impingement, and integrated for total collection efficiency.
Impingement limits and collection efficiency are often presented.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The method of calculation is a step-wise approximation
and may be derived by methods similar to those used for obtaining the
droplet distribution in the section METHOD OF DETERMINING DROPLET-SIZE
DISTRIBUTION. The results of such an analysis would be useful in (1)
calculating the impingement rates for a body in a cloud of arbitrary
droplet size distribution, and (2) determining whether the assumptions
used in theoretical trajectory calculations are valid. This determination 
requires an independent means (reliable instrument) for measuring
the droplet size distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy of the various drop distributions shown above are unknown, 
due to the lack of an independent comparison measurement. 
I do not know of data from the NACA era that could clarify the accuracy. 
We will look at a comparison of post-NACA data in the <a href="/conclusions-of-the-cylinder-thread.html">Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread</a>.</p>
