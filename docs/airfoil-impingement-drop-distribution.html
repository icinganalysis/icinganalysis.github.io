<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Is this an instrument?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>These three publications discuss water drop impingement, 
without mentioning an instrument. 
One might wonder why 
these were included in the "Meteorological Instrument" section 
of <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a>, 
when there is also a large "Impingement of Cloud Droplets" section.  </p>
<p>However, the later <a href="/naca-tn-3338.html">NACA-TN-3338</a> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> 
does describe measuring a drop size 
distribution based on the impingement rates on a cylinder, 
measured with the dye tracer method in a wind tunnel,
and the method could be used for airfoils. 
While it was not developed in to a practical flight instrument, 
it is interesting. </p>
<p>I will honor <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">Uwe von Glahn's categorizations</a>, 
and review these publications in this <a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">"Meteorological Instruments" thread</a>.  </p>
<h3>Low cost, approximate impingement values</h3>
<p>A motivation for these three publications was that the use of a 
differential analyzer was expensive and time-consuming. 
The water drop equations of motion are included in all three, 
were solved using a differential analyzer 
(for more details see <a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">"Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories"</a>. 
However, the differential analyzer device was large, 
expensive, and labor-intensive to operate. 
A large entity (like General Electric) might own one, 
but they were also available for rent at a few locations.  </p>
<p>It is hard to design an ice protection system without knowing 
how much water is hitting where on an airfoil.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the designer is therefore
confronted with the desirability of employing a computation method,
preferably without the necessity of a differential analyzer, which
will provide some indication of the area and distribution of water
impingement.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three publications provide numerous tables, graphs, 
and an "equivalent cylinder" method 
to obtain approximate impingement values without the use 
of a differential analyzer. </p>
<h3>Airfoils</h3>
<p>NACA-TN-1397 <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>12—percent—thick symmetrical Joukowski profile chosen to
simulate an NACA 0012 section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-2476 <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The five airfoil cases selected for the water-drop-trajectory
investigation are listed in the following table:<br>
<img alt="NACA-TN-2476 Table of airfoils" src="images/NACA-TN-2476/Table of airfoils.png"><br>
<em>["Do" is apparently short for "ditto", or "same as above".]</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An advantage of the Joukowski airfoils for analysis was that the 
flow solution for a cylinder 
(an analytic function, for incompressible, inviscid flow) 
can be mapped onto a Joukowski airfoil section. 
[We might go into more detail on that in a post in the distant future.]  </p>
<p>NACA-RM-E52B12:<br>
As stated in the abstract above, a NACA 65<sub>1</sub>-212
airfoil at an angle of attack of 4° was analyzed over a broad range of conditions.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NACA 65-series airfoil sections are particularly adaptable to airplanes 
having high-level flight speeds. An airfoil 12 percent thick was
chosen as adaptable to transport and cargo airplanes. An angle of attack
of 4° was chosen as being representative of low cruise attitude for a
turbojet-powered aircraft operated under conditions giving a relatively
large area of droplet impingement on the airfoil.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>NACA-TN-1397 "equivalent" cylinder analysis</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The designer of a heated wing, desiring to know the rate and
area of water impingement on the leading edge in a specified cloud at
a given flight speed, might assume that the impingement limit be
identical to that for a cylinder with a radius equal to the wing
leading-edge radius. There is some question, however, as to the
accuracy of this assumption for the larger drop sizes and for wing
sections with small leading-edge radii. The designer is therefore
confronted with the desirability of employing a computation method,
preferably without the necessity of a differential analyzer, which
will provide some indication of the area and. distribution of water
impingement.<br>
In this report, the water-drop trajectory equations used in
reference 3 have been modified to establish a step-by-step integration 
method applicable to any two-dimensional flow for which the
streamline velocity components are known or can be approximated. If
drop trajectories for a large range of airspeeds and drop diameters
are required, the computation time is large, arid the desirability of
access to a differential analyzer becomes evident. The integration
method presented herein, however, does permit the calculation of
any desired number of trajectories without resort to an analyzer; and
it also provides a means for estimating the error which will be
incurred by replacing the airfoil by a cylinder with a radius equal
to the leading-edge radius of the airfoil. In addition, water-impingement 
data over the entire airfoil surface can be obtained by
the integration method.
...</p>
<p>With the set of trajectories calculated by the step—by—step
process and presented in figure 6, a comparison can be made between
the impingement of water drops on the Joukowski airfoil and its
equivalent cylinder, for a small range in drop sizes. Such a comparison
is made in figure 10, where the airfoil was used as the basis for
comparison. For area of impingement, the equivalent cylinder can be
used without much error to a drop—size diameter of approximately 20
microns. However, for rate of impingement, appreciable difference
is not encountered until drop diameters are above 3O microns. It is
of interest to note that meteorological data obtained in flight
(reference 5) indicate a mean-effective drop-size diameter 2 for
cumulus clouds of 15 to 25 microns. Furthermore, mean-effective drop
diameters as high as 50 microns have been measured in clouds of the
altostratus category. Since, in accordance with the definition of
mean-effective drop diameter, half the water contained in a cloud
sample is composed of drops larger than the mean-effective diameter,
it is apparent that the use of an equivalent cylinder may be subject
to considerable error when applied to typical icing conditions in
which large drop-size diameters have been observed.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>2. The rate and area of water-drop impingement on an NACA 0012
airfoil having an 8-foot chord is approximated with reasonable
accuracy by the impingement on a cylinder of radius equal to the
leading-edge radius of the airfoil for only drop diameters below 20
microns at speeds of about 200 miles per hour and at an altitude of
7000 feet.

<h3>NACA-TN-2476</h3>
<p>NACA-TN-2476 is long (152 pages), and complex (it cites 38 publications). 
Frankly, only the most dedicated students of impingement analysis history 
will read it all, 
and today one is unlikely to use the methods detailed therein.</p>
<p>See if you can wrap your thoughts around the "hodographs" presented.  </p>

<em>Figure 19 from NACA-TN-2476</em>  </p>
<h3>Mechanical Analog</h3>
<p>NACA-RM-E52B12 mentions a "mechanical analog" used to solve the 
water drop equations of motion.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>METHOD OF SOLUTION<br>
The differential equations of motion (equation (i)) are difficult
to solve by ordinary means because the values of the velocity components
of the air and the term containing the coefficient of drag are not known
until the trajectory is traced. These values are determined as the
trajectory of a droplet is developed because the magnitudes depend on
the position of the droplet in the flow field. Simultaneous solutions
for the two equations were obtained with the use of a mechanical analog
constructed at the Lewis laboratory for this purpose. The answers were
obtained in the form of plots of the droplet trajectories with respect
to the airfoil. The coefficient of drag CD for the droplets, required
in equations (1), was obtained from tables in references 2 and 3.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/naca-tn-2904.html">NACA-TN-2904</a> tell us more about the mechanical analog:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The water droplet trajectories were computed on a mechanical analog 
which was fundamentally a differential
analyzer constructed for solving the equations of motion (equations (1)
and (2)).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>Impingement Analysis</h3>
<p>The "Impingement of Cloud Droplets" section of 
<a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a>, 
has 25 publications, so I will defer a detailed discussion to a future topic thread. </p>
<p>There was a lot of analysis and some tests conducted to determine impingement rates, 
and the methods mentioned above were used to estimate approximate impingement 
rates without having to run an expensive analysis.  </p>
<p>Today, one is likely to use analysis methods such as LEWICE <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> 
to perform comparable impingement analysis.  </p>
<h3>Inferring a drop size distribution</h3>
<p>In the conclusions of NACA-TN-1397, it was stated:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>4. The area and distribution of water-drop impingement on an
airfoil in motion through a cloud of known drop-size distribution can
be obtained by calculating the area and distribution of impingement
for each drop-size range present.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This procedure can be reversed, as detailed in <a href="/naca-tn-3338.html">NACA-TN-3338</a> <sup id="fnref2:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, 
to determine a drop size distribution, if one has measured impingement data. 
To briefly outline, a drop size distribution is assumed, 
and the impingement for the largest drop size bin calculated. 
This is compared to the measured impingement rate 
for the area near the impingement limits to calculate 
the fraction of total water in that drop size bin. 
This is then repeated for each size bin. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 17. Typical exerimental impingement rate for cylinder showing 
arbitrary increments of central angle theta and including contributions 
of several drop size groups." src="images/naca-tn-3338/Figure17.png"><br>
<em>Figure 17 of NACA-TN-3338</em>  </p>
<p>This method saw limited use for tunnel tests, 
and was not well-suited to use in natural icing, 
as a calibrated amount of dye was needed to be mixed 
into the impinging water drops. </p>
<p>NACA-TN-4035 <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> discusses building an airfoil impingement  instrument, 
but did not test one.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The replacement of cylinders by a Joukowski airfoil for measuring
instruments is required only when the airflow around the cylinder is not
comparable to the theoretical flow used in the calculations of reference 1.
The 36.5-percent-thick Joukowski airfoil retains many of the desirable
properties of the cylinder and has the necessary flow field that permits
the application of calculated results in a range of operating conditions
not possible with cylinders. The least desirable feature of the airfoil
is that the shape changes as ice accumulates on the surface. This feature
is of no consequence when the airfoil is used with the dye-tracer technique
in tunnels.  </p>
