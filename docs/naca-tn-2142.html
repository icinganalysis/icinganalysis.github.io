<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A photomicrographic technique for investigating supercooled
water droplets has been devised and used to determine the
spontaneous freezing temperatures of supercooled. water droplets
of the size ordinarily found. in the atmosphere. The freezing
temperatures of 4527 droplets ranging from 8.75 to 1000 microns
in diameter supported on a platinum surface and 571 droplets
supported on copper were obtained.   </p>
<p>The average spontaneous freezing temperature decreased with
decrease in the size of the droplets. The effect of size on the
spontaneous freezing temperature was particularly marked below
60 microns. Frequency-distribution curves of the spontaneous
freezing temperatures observed for droplets of a given size were
obtained. Although no droplet froze at a temperature above 20° F,
all droplets melted at 32° F. Results obtained with a copper
support did not differ essentially from those obtained with a
platinum surface.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is the first in a series of NACA studies on the properties of supercooled water. 
Previous publications were reviewed, a new instrument developed, 
and spontaneous freezing temperatures determined as a function of drop size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION
Although many important advances have been made in the control
of ice formation on aircraft in flight, little progress has been
made toward an understanding of the fundamental processes involved
in the formation of ice or the prediction of such formation.<br>
Because the presence of supercooled water in the atmosphere
is primarily responsible for aircraft icing, it is necessary to
know the properties of supercooled water for a complete understanding 
of the icing process. 
Although supercooled water has been
observed and reported for over two centuries, considerable disagreement 
exists as to the degree of supercooling possible and the
factors that influence supercooling.<br>
During the last 20 years, a few systematic laboratory
investigations of supercooled water have been conducted. The
studies of Meyer and Pfaff (reference 1), Tammann and Bickner
(reference 2), and Rau (presented in reference 3) in Germany,
Doucet (reference 4) in France, Cwilong (reference 5) in England,
and Dorsey (references 6 and 7) and Heverly (reference 8) in the
United States are of particular interest.
Three of the many factors investigated that are thought to
influence the degree of supercooling may be particularly important
in the prediction of aircraft icing in a supercooled cloud:<br>
1. Effect of contaminating agents, such as undissolved.
substances in the water<br>
2. Quantity of water comprising the sample, for example, the
diameter of a supercooled droplet<br>
3. Length of time the droplet has been at or below 32° F<br>
The results reported in references 1 and 2 on bulk water
indicate that impurities in the water are an important factor In
its supercoolability </p>
<p>The purpose of an investigation conducted at the NACA Lewis
laboratory, and described herein was to study the spontaneous freezing 
temperatures of droplets within the size range encountered in a
supercooled icing cloud in order to determine size dependency.
Because the spontaneous freezing temperatures of various samples of
water investigated by Dorsey (reference 7) differed by as much as
29° F, although all samples were approximately the same volume, a
statistical study of water droplets was made to determine If similar
variations in freezing temperature exist for droplets of a fixed
size. No attempt was made to find any absolute minimum temperature
limit for the existence of supercooled water or to determine the
effect of time on the spontaneous freezing temperature. Although
further research under conditions closely duplicating the supercooled 
cloud in the atmosphere is necessary, it is believed that
the effect of size and presence of impurities on the state of the
water droplets in a natural cloud may be similar to that found in
this investigation.</p>
<p>APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE<br>
The apparatus employed for this investigation is schematically
shown in figure 1. The droplet-supporting surface (fig. 1(b)) consisted 
of very thin (0.003-in.) platinum foil 0.180 inch in diameter. 
Sandwiched between the foil and a temperature equalizing
plate of 1/32-inch sheet copper was an iron-constantan thermocouple
(No. 28 wire) in excellent thermal contact with the platinum. The
copper was soldered to the top of a small cylindrical piece of steel
that was heated by induction from a surrounding copper coil. The
steel was attached on its lower side to a copper rod that was
immersed in a cold bath consisting of dry ice and the solvent Varsol.
Radio-frequency heating was used to compensate for the heat sink.
The temperature could be rapidly changed or kept nearly constant
by varying the power supplied to the radio-frequency oscillator.
The platinum support surface was surrounded by a small brass chamber
with plastic observation ports. This chamber provided a local
atmosphere that was isolated from the exterior atmosphere...</p>

<p>The platinum surface was presumably selected to have a low potential for 
chemically interacting with the water drops.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A microscope lamp at a 20° angle with the surface
was used for illumination. The windows were kept free of condensation 
by a very light jet of air directed against their external
side. A general view of the apparatus with the low-magnification
chamber in place is shown in figure 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Apparatus with low-magnification chamber in place." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2142%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<p>The water used for the drops was obtained through deposition (frost), 
so it was presumably rather pure, with the possible exception of dust particles
("it is believed that
the effect of size and presence of impurities on the state of the
water droplets in a natural cloud may be similar to that found in
this investigation").</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water droplets were obtained on the surface and then supercooled 
by the following procedure: Frost was deposited on the
surface by lowering the temperature to approximately -30° F; the
frost was then melted. Because of surface tension, the water
gathered into small approximately hemispherical droplets. The
average size of the group of droplets obtained depended on the
amount of frost gathered. Next, the temperature was lowered to
32° F and then decreased at a rate of 0.2° to 0.5° F per second.</p>
<p>The spontaneous freezing of the droplets was determined by
a change in appearance on freezing. In studying each droplet in
the photomicrograph frame-by-frame throughout its cooling history,
a frame was reached In which a sudden change in opacity occurred.
The corresponding temperature was taken as the freezing temperature. 
As a check on the reliability of this method, a comparison
was made between the freezing temperature of large droplets (over
500 microns) obtained by observing the abrupt temperature rise
associated with the release of latent heat, and the visual method.
In all cases investigated, the temperature at which the abrupt
temperature rise occurred corresponded to the freezing temperature
as determined from the frame number of the photograph showing a
change in opacity. For droplets smaller than 500 microns, the
latent heat released could not be detected by the thermocouple in
most cases. A very large drop (1600 microns) is shown before and
after freezing in figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In the
1-second interval between the two pictures (frames 110 and 111),
the large drop in the lower right quadrant of the supporting
surface turned opaque or milky.  </p>

<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>The spontaneous freezing of 5098 droplets was observed. The
size, the length of time below the melting point, and the spontaneous 
freezing temperature of each droplet were recorded. The
distribution of droplet sizes for which the spontaneous freezing
temperatures were determined is shown in figure 6. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The region
investigated in this report corresponds fairly well to the droplet
sizes ordinarily found in natural clouds when it is considered that
spherical droplets of the same volume as hemispheres would have
smaller diameters than that given for the near-hemispherical
droplets studied in this report and that the mean effective droplet 
diameter is a volume-median droplet size.</p>
<p>The variation of average, maximum, and minimum freezing
temperatures with droplet size taken from the data used for
figure 8, with additional data on droplets up to 1000 microns, are
shown in figure 10. The average spontaneous freezing temperature
for each size decreased as the droplet size decreased for the
entire size range. Below 60 microns, the spontaneous freezing
temperature decreased rapidly with size. This curve shows the same
trend as that published by Heverly (reference 8). The pronounced
change in slope in Heverly's curve at 400 microns appears at
60 microns in the data of this report. The wide variation in
spontaneous freezing temperature for droplets of a given size is
indicated, by the large separation of the curves for the maximum
and. minimum temperatures observed for each size. None of the
4527 droplets supported by the platinum surface was observed to
freeze spontaneously at a temperature above 20° or below -38° F,
but all droplets melted at 32° F.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The spontaneous freezing temperatures of 4527 droplets on a
platinum surface and 571 droplets on a copper surface in the range
8.75 to 1000 microns were observed and the following results were
obtained.:<br>
1. The average spontaneous freezing temperature for each size
decreased. as the droplet size decreased, for the entire range
investigated. Below 60 microns, the decrease in the spontaneous
freezing temperature with decrease in droplet size was particularly
marked.<br>
2. The frequency of occurrence as a function of the freezing
temperature of droplets of a given size provided a distribution
curve with a well-defined peak frequency. 
3. The spontaneous freezing temperature of a given droplet
tended to be the same on successive freezings.<br>
4. No droplet froze spontaneously at a temperature above 22° F,
but all droplets melted at 32° F.<br>
5. Spontaneous freezing data taken with a copper supporting
surface were not significantly different from that taken with a
platinum support.  </p>
