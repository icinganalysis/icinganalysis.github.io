<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigations have been made in flight and in wind tunnels tc
determine which components of turbojet installations are most critical
in icing conditions, and to evaluate several methods of icing protection. 
From these studies, the requirements necessary for adequate
icing protection and the consequent penalties on engine performance
can be estimated.  </p>
<p>Because investigations have indicated that the compressor-inlet
screen constitutes the greatest icing hazard and is difficult to protect, 
complete removal or retraction of the screen upon encountering
an icing condition is recommended. In the absence of the screen, the
inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine constitute the
greatest danger to engine operation in an icing condition; a centrifugal-
type engine, on the other hand, is relatively unsusceptible to icing
once the screen has been removed.  </p>
<p>Of the three icing-protection systems investigated, surface heat-
ing, hot-gas bleedback, and inertia-separation inlets, only the first
two offer an acceptable solution to the problem of engine icing protection. 
Surface heating, either by gas heating or electrical means,
appears to be the most acceptable icing-protection method with regard
to performance losses. Hot-gas bleedback, although causing undesirable
thrust losses, offers an easy means of obtaining icing protection for
some installations. The final choice of an icing-protection system
depends, however, on the supply of heated gas and electrical power
available and on the allowable performance and. weight penalties
associated with each system.  </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As this publication is long (78 pages), this review will focus mostly on the 
configuration descriptions and conclusions, 
and less on specific test results.

<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The development of high-performance turbojet engines and the
advent of all-weather turbojet-propelled aircraft have necessitated
extensive research programs to determine methods for icing protection
of the various components of such engine installations. Not only is
the inlet ducting of a turbojet-engine installation subject to icing,
but, more important, the internal elements such as the compressor-inlet screen, 
the inlet guide vanes, and the compressor blading are
also subject to icing. Ice formations on the internal elements
seriously affect the operation and the performance characteristics of
a turbojet engine. The ice formations on the screen and the inlet guide
vanes reduce the compressor-inlet area and increase the pressure losses.
In addition, ice formations on the compressor blading may decrease the
compressor efficiency and thus further reduce the pressure available in
the engine. The over-all pressure and mass-flow losses of the entire
turbojet-engine installation markedly decrease the propulsive thrust,
particularly at high flight Mach numbers (reference 1). Serious icing
of a turbojet-engine installation may render the engine inoperative in
a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The scope of NACA turbojet-engine icing investigations to date has
been threefold: (1) to study the effect of icing on turbojet-engine
performance, (2) to evaluate the feasibility and the practicability of
several methods for protecting turbojet engines from icing, and (3) to
determine the effects of these ice-protection methods on engine performance 
under both dry and icing conditions. The investigations were
carried out at the NACA Lewis laboratory in natural-flight icing conditions 
and under simulated icing conditions using a water-spray system
in the altitude wind tunnel and the icing research tunnel.  </p>
<p>The icing investigations in natural-flight icing conditions were
confined to the determination of the effect of icing on turbojet-engine
performance. Investigations in the altitude wind tunnel included the
three phases of icing investigations previously mentioned. Studies in
the icing research tunnel were primarily concerned with several methods
of ice protection for turbojet-engine inlets and an evaluation of the
effects of these methods on engine performance.   </p>
<p>Three basic methods have been advanced for the icing protection
of turbojet engines:<br>
(1) Local heating of all surfaces subject to icing (fig. 1). Surface 
heating may be accomplished by<br>
(a) passing heated gases through passages within the component walls, 
(b) internal or external electrical heating pads or films, and 
(c) electrical eddy currents induced by a pulsating magnetic field in the elements to be protected. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) Addition of heat to the entire mass of air passing through
the inlet (fig. 2), which raises the inlet-air temperature above
freezing. By injecting hot gas into the air stream at the inlet, the
engine and most components in the inlet duct are afforded icing protection 
in one operation.  </p>

<p>(3) Inertia separation of supercooled water droplets out of the
engine-inlet air stream by special inlet and duct design (fig. 3). The
duct design consists of a single inlet opening followed by a main duct
for nonicing operation and an alternate duct with sharply curved passages 
through which air, with a greatly reduced water content in an
icing condition, can pass to the compressor inlet.  </p>

<p>A summary based on the collective results of all NACA investigations 
to date on turbojet-engine ice protection is presented herein.  </p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES  </p>
<p>Icing investigations of turbojet engines and inlets were conducted
at the NACA Lewis laboratory in the following three phases:  </p>
<p>Flight. - Two flight investigations of the effect of icing on
turbojet engines were conducted, one using a centrifugal-flow-type
engine and the other using an axial-flow-type engine. In the first
flight investigation (unpublished), a centrifugal-flow-type turbojet
engine with a static-thrust rating of 1600 pounds at sea level and a
double-entry inlet was installed in the waist compartment of a large
four-engine bomber-type aircraft (fig. 4). An air inlet for the
turbojet engine was installed on top of the fuselage and the exhaust
gases were expelled from the tail portion of the aircraft. The turbojet 
engine was instrumented to provide data for determining specific
fuel consumption, turbine-outlet temperatures, and air flow. The 
investigation was conducted in flight under mild natural icing conditions;
consequently, the liquid-water content of the air was augmented by
means of a battery of spray nozzles located ahead of the engine air
scoop atop the fuselage.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the second flight investigation (references 2 to 4), an axial-
flow-type engine of approximately 3000-pound rated sea-level static
thrust was studied; The engine was mounted below the wing of a large
four-engine bomber-type aircraft (fig. 5) and was instrumented to
determine the effects of icing on engine performance. During the
investigation, no compressor-inlet screen was used. Photographs of
engine icing in flight were obtained with a camera so located that it
could be swung into position to obtain pictures of the engine inlets.
All investigations with this installation were conducted in natural
flight icing conditions. The aircraft was also provided with equipment
to evaluate the meteorological conditions prevailing throughout the
flights.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Altitude wind tunnel. - An axial-flow-type engine similar to that
used in the second flight investigation was mounted in a wing nacelle
in the test section of the altitude wind tunnel (reference 5). This
engine was fitted with an experimental hot-gas bleedback ice-protection
system. The engine was instrumented to provide data for evaluating the
performance of the engine and the hot-gas bleedback system in icing
conditions. The investigations were conducted at various pressure
altitudes up to 20,000 feet in simulated-icing conditions using spray
nozzles.  </p>
<p>Icing research tunnel. - Various ice-protection methods were evaluated 
in the 6- by 9-foot test section of the icing research tunnel
with scaled research mockups of turbojet-engine-inlet components.
Icing conditions with air temperatures as low as -30 F were obtained at
air speeds up to 300 miles per hour and pressure altitudes below 3500
feet. Cloud droplet sizes and liquid-water contents in the tunnel
were measured by the rotating-multicylinder method and were in the
range of natural icing conditions. All models were instrumented to
obtain pertinent pressure and temperature data.</p>
<p>ICING CHARACTERISTICS OF TURBOJET-ENGINE INSTALLATIONS<br>
General Considerations  </p>
<p>All surfaces of a jet-engine installation that are exposed to
direct impingement of water droplets may require icing protection
(fig. 1). The engine and inlet components that are subject to icing are
therefore inlet lips, accessory housing dome, islands and island
fairings, compressor-inlet screen, inlet guide vanes, and compressor
blading. In addition, other surfaces may require icing protection, such
as duct-splitter plates, openings for boundary-layer bleedoff and
accessory-cooling purposes, and curved inlet-duct walls subject to
impingement caused by water separation from the inlet air stream.  </p>
<p>Meteorological factors. - The principal meteorological factors that
contribute to icing are liquid-water content, air temperature, and
droplet size. The rapidity with which ice builds up on the engine components 
and the time required to render the engine inoperative depend
on the liquid-water content. The type of ice formation that occurs
depends on the air temperature and the droplet size. Generally, the
ice formations may be separated into two categories: (1) double-peaked
glaze-ice formations in which the outer edges protrude laterally and
forward into the air stream (fig. 6), and (2) wedge-shaped rime-ice
formations, which build forward from the impingement area. Glaze icing
is usually associated with air temperatures near freezing and relatively
large droplet sizes. Rime icing is usually associated with low air
temperatures and small droplet sizes.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 6. Typical double-peaked glaze-ice formation on inlet lips of turbojet-engine installation." src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E51B12%2FFigure%206.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The known meteorological factors conducive to aircraft icing are
arranged in several classifications in reference 6. The range of possible 
meteorological factors in each classification is discussed and.
specific values are recommended for the analysis of the various aircraft 
components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 6 is <a href="/naca-tn-1855.html">NACA-TN-1855</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geometric and aerodynamic factors. - The paths of droplets are primarily 
influenced by the flow field about a body and the relative size
of the droplets and the body. Because the flow field is determined by
the shape of the body and the relative motion of the air stream, the
shape greatly affects the extent of icing. Also, as the size of the
body decreases relative to that of the droplet, the local icing rate
is increased.  </p>
<p>Icing of a turbojet engine is therefore affected by the aerodynamic
characteristics of the engine installation. The number of water droplets 
entering the engine inlet is influenced by the inlet-velocity ratio
(ratio of inlet-air velocity to the free-stream velocity), as illustrated 
in figure 7. The droplets contained within the limiting droplet
trajectories enter the inlet whereas all droplets outside the limiting
trajectories either impinge on the inlet body or pass around it. When
the inlet-velocity ratio is less than 1.0, the area contained within
the limiting droplet trajectories is greater than the area within the
lip stagnation streamlines; hence the liquid-water content in the inlet
is increased above that in the ambient air (fig. 7(a)). For an inlet-velocity 
ratio greater than 1.0, the area within the limiting trajectories 
is less than the area within the stagnation streamlines; hence
the liquid-water content in the inlet is decreased below that in the
ambient air (fig. 7(b)). Because of the scooping effect and the divergence 
of the streamlines when the inlet-velocity ratio is less than 1.0,
icing on the inlet-duct walls may be expected.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The temperature-rise characteristics of each compressor stage and
the adiabatic temperature change caused by flight speed influence the
distance into the engine that ice formations occur. Obviously, as the
temperature on the engine surfaces reaches a point above the freezing
level, no ice will form.</p>
<p>Typical Icing of Components  </p>
<p>The icing tolerance of a turbojet engine is limited by the component 
having the smallest and most closely spaced elements. A
compressor-inlet screen therefore constitutes the greatest icing hazard.
In the absence of the compressor-inlet screen, the inlet guide vanes
become the critical component. Examples of typical icing of turbojet-engine 
components are described in the following sections...  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Effect of icing on axial-flow-type turbojet-engine performance. -
The results of studies of icing effects on axial-flow-type engine
performance are shown in figures 13 to 15. In natural flight icing conditions 
(fig. 13) with an axial-flow-type engine operating at 92 percent
of rated engine speed, the engine thrust loss was 26 percent with an
attendant 1600 F tail-pipe-temperature rise after an effective duration
of approximately 30 minutes in icing (reference 4). During the time
shown by the dotted portion of the curve, the icing was too intermittent
and light for reliable measurements and the engine was stopped to conserve fuel. 
A photograph of the engine ice formations that caused the
26-percent loss in thrust is shown in figure 14. The compressor inlet
is considerably blocked by large ice formations shed from the islands.
In addition, ice can be plainly seen on the inlet guide vanes. The
increase in thrust near the end of the run was caused by the breakup
and subsequent passing through the engine of some of the large ice
formations on the islands. Data presented in reference 4 indicate that
the initial rate of thrust loss may be as high as 14 percent within
31 minutes of encountering an icing condition of moderate severity.
After an initial rapid thrust loss, the rate at which the thrust is
decreased may be reduced if the ice formations become dislodged or
break off.</p>

meter; effective icing time, 33 minutes; thrust loss, 26 percent." src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E51B12%2FFigure%2014.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Damage caused by ice. - Shedding of large ice formations from components 
ahead of the compressor inlet when no compressor-inlet screen is
used may cause engine blow-out and structural damage. An indication of
the quantity of ice that may be shed from the inlet and the engine components 
and subsequently swallowed by the compressor is shown in figure 17 
(reference 4). A photograph of the ice formations 1 minute
before shedding occurred is shown in figure 17(a); figure 17(b) was
taken 1 minute after the shedding of the ice formations. This sudden
intake of ice caused a momentary drop of about 1000 rpm in engine speed.
Inspection after shutdown showed no damage to the engine.  </p>
<p>Ice shedding from inlet lips, accessory housing, and islands generally 
shatters into small pieces and passes harmlessly through the
engine. Damage may occur if a large piece of ice lodges in the space
between a rotor- and stator-blade stage or if a large piece strikes a
rotor blade and deflects it into the guide vanes or stator blades.
Wider inlet-guide-vane spacing permits passage of large ice pieces
into the compressor and thereby increases the possibility of damage to
the engine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freezing of water in the compressor daring outside parking or
storage of an aircraft may result in damage if an attempt is made to
start the engine before de-icing the compressor blading.
No damage resulting from icing of centrifugal-flow-type turbojet
engines has been reported to date.</p>
<p>Submerged-Inlet System</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Other investigations of submerged-type inlets used in conjunction
with fuel-cell vents are reported in reference 38. A typical vent
installation using a submerged-type inlet mounted in the underside of
a wing is shown in figure 36(a). Icing was observed on all surfaces of
the inlet, namely, the ramp, the diverging sidewalls, and the inlet lip
as shown in figure 36(b), and also on the wing surface ahead of the
inlet. Although the air flow through the inlet (vent tubes) was quite
low, the pressure losses associated with these ice formations (especially 
those on the surface ahead of the inlet) were found to be very high.
Severe aerodynamic penalties can consequently be anticipated for engine
installations requiring large quantities of air flow. Icing protection
is therefore required for submerged-inlet components.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The need for icing protection of a turbojet engine results from
the mass-flow and pressure losses associated with the icing of the various 
engine components. The compressor-inlet screen, in particular,
constitutes a hazard that can cause engine failure in a matter of minutes. 
The inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine also
represent a distinct hazard that could cause engine shutdown in a short
period of time. The removal or retraction of the inlet screen is recommended 
to increase the engine icing tolerance and permit easier icing
protection. In addition, an increase in the size and the spacing of the
inlet guide vanes would be desirable. The rest of the engine components
such as the inlet lips, the duct surfaces, the islands, and the accessory 
housing may require icing protection. The performance losses
associated with icing of these components do not constitute an immediate
danger to engine operation. The loss in performance caused by these
ice formations may, however, result in a considerable decrease in the
range and the speed of the aircraft. A centrifugal-flow-type turbojet
engine is relatively unsusceptible to icing once the compressor screen
has been removed.  </p>
<p>Surface heating with hot gas involves the fabrication of ducts and
passages beneath the surfaces to be heated. High-temperature materials
and insulation add fabrication problems and small weight penalties.
With either compressor-outlet or turbine-inlet bleedoff, heating of
critical elements, such as guide vanes, can usually be accomplished with
sufficient pressure and temperature remaining at the vane outlets to
supply protection for some of the secondary elements, such as accessory 
housings and inlet ducts. During let-down conditions, the available 
gas pressure and temperature may be marginal for protection of
the engine in severe icing conditions.  </p>
<p>Difficulties encountered in the fabrication of electrical heating
elements and the maintenance problems of an electrical heating system
appear to be greater than for a hot-gas system.  </p>
<p>The hot-gas-bleedback system (for heating inlet air) can be applied
to current engines with minor modifications to the engine installation.
The high temperatures and pressures required may be obtained by the
bleedback of turbine-inlet gas or by compressor-outlet air with reheat.</p>
<p>A hot-gas-bleedback system that employs combustion gases will pollute
the inlet air and affect the use of the compressor air for cabin 
pressurization purposes.  </p>
<p>Icing protection may be obtained by any of the previously described
systems. All the systems penalize the aircraft in icing conditions,
either by performance losses caused by weight increases, or by thrust
losses and increased specific fuel consumption; in nonicing conditions,
however, the performance losses are negligible. Surface heating, by
either electrical means or hot gas, appears to be the most acceptable
in relation to performance losses in icing conditions. The choice of
any particular system is dependent on the supply of heated gas and
electrical power available and on the allowable performance and
weight penalties.  </p>
