<p>NASA TM 83564:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary  </p>
<p>This paper deals with the initial results of
the NASA Lewis Research Center's flight research
in quantifying the performance of an aircraft in
various measured icing conditions. Flight
research performed in natural icing conditions
supports a number of major program elements at
NASA. One of these elements is to develop
analytical methods (computer codes) that predict
aircraft performance degradation in a given icing
condition. A major problem in developing these
codes has been the lack of an experimental data
base where measurements of the natural icing
environment were associated with a corresponding
measurement of aircraft performance degradation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NASA TM 83564:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract  </p>
<p>Aircraft icing flight research was performed
in natural icing conditions with a typical twin
engine commuter type aircraft. Development of a
data base consisting of icing cloud parameter
measurements, ice shapes, and aerodynamic measurements 
was begun. Results from five icing research
flights are presented. During research icing
encounters, icing cloud parameters such as temperature, 
liquid water content, and droplet size were
measured. After the icing encounter, ice shapes
were documented and aerodynamic measurements were
taken. The ice accretion shape on the wing was
documented with a stereo photography system. The
increase in wing section drag was measured with a
wake survey probe. The overall aircraft performance 
loss in terms of lift and drag coefficient
changes was obtained by taking steady level speed/power 
measurements. Selective deicing of airframe
components was performed to determine their contributions 
to the total drag increase. Engine out
capability was analyzed for the iced aircraft. It
was shown that the stereo photography system can
be used to document ice shapes in flight and that
the wake survey probe can measure increases in wing
section drag caused by ice. On one flight, the
wing section drag coefficient (Cd) increased
approximately 120 percent over the uniced baseline
at an aircraft angle of attack of 6Â°. On another
flight, the aircraft drag coefficient (CD) increased 
by 75 percent over the uniced baseline at
an aircraft lift coefficient (Cl) of 0.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The instruments used in NASA TM 83564:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instrumentation<br>
Icing Cloud Parameters<br>
Measurements were made of cloud liquid water
content, cloud droplet size distribution, volume
median diameter, air temperature, ice accretion
rate, and duration of the icing encounters.
Photographs were taken in flight of the ice accretions 
on the outboard section of the wing leading
edge and of other airframe components visible from
the cockpit and cabin.<br>
Instrumentation included:<br>
For liquid water content: Johnson and Williams (J-W) heated wire produced by Cloud Technology (fig. 2(a));<br>
For cloud droplet size distribution and volume median diameter: rotating multi-cylinder (fig.2(b));<br>
For air temperature: platinum resistance total temperature probe produced by Rosemount (fig. 2(c));<br>
For ice accretion: Pressure-type Icing Rate and Accretion Meter (PIRAM) developed by NACA (fig 2(d)).   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For NASA TM 86906, a "sooted slide droplet catcher" was also included.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2b. Rotating multi-cylinder for measuring water droplet size distribution." src="/images%2FNASA%20TM%2083564%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2d. PIRAM for measuring reference ice accretion rates and total accretion." src="/images%2FNASA%20TM%2083564%2FFigure%202d.png"><br>
<em>The barely legible stamp near the top reads "ORIGINAL PAGE IS OF POOR QUALITY".</em>  </p>
<p>I believe that this was the latest icing flight test use (1984) 
of the rotating multicylinder or sooted slide droplet catcher instruments. 
A later test in the series (flight in 1985) <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> included the PIRAM, 
but used a forward scattering spectrometer probe 
and an optical array probe for drop size measurement. 
The latest use of the PIRAM may have been 1985. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Icing parameters such as liquid water content, 
temperature, cloud droplet sizes, and ice
accretions were measured with icing instruments
mounted on the research aircraft. Continuous
on-line reading of these instruments provided a
quantitative display of the icing environment,
Thus, when icing was detected the extent of the
icing could be monitored and controlled by holding
within the icing area.  </p>
<p>Following each measured icing encounter,
level flight speed/power runs were made from maximum 
obtainable level flight speed to a speed just
above stall. When possible, repeat runs were made
after selectively deicing the wings and empennage. 
Flight data were reduced to provide plots
of the aircraft drag polar for the measured "iced"
condition and a lift curve (CL vs. _) as referenced
to the uniced or clean airframe baseline. In
order to determine the effect of icing on
engine-out performance capability, these data were
also reduced to provide plots of thrust horsepower
required vs. single engine power available.</p>
<p>Aircraft performance measurements are referenced to 
those characteristics of the icing condition that created 
the ice accretions. Performance
degradation is primarily influenced by the amount
and shape of the accumulated ice. The amount of
ice was measured but shape was not quantitatively
determined. In addition to presenting specific
values of the icing variables, the icing encounters 
were characterized in terms of their relation
to frequency of occurrence and the FAA icing cloud
criteria for ice protection systems.  </p>
<p>Glaze icing caused the greatest aerodynamic
performance penalties in terms of increased drag
and reduction in lift. Rime icing provided
proportionately lower aerodynamic performance
penalties.  </p>
<p>Data acquired through this flight test program will 
provide a basis to develop aircraft performance 
prediction codes for icing conditions. 
One such code is being developed under a NASA
Lewis Research Center grant by the Ohio State
University. The geometry of the icing research
aircraft, along with the measured icing environment 
and corresponding aircraft performance
degradation data, will be used to provide a basis
for the development of this code.</p>

<p>Conclusions  </p>
<p>Icing can be characterized with
respect to those conditions that caused the ice accretions
including<br>
(1) the basic icing cloud variables such
as liquid water content, droplet size distributions, volume median diameter, 
temperature, and extent of the icing cloud and<br>
(2) the properties
of the ice accretions such as ice type, shape,
icing rate, and reference total accretion.<br>
Aircraft performance can then be associated with
these parameters or displayed with more familiar
criteria such as FAR 25 appendix C icing certification requirements.  </p>
<p>Glaze icing, which generally occurs at total
air temperatures just below freezing, results in
rough, irregular ice formations with flat or concave 
surfaces facing the airstream. This type of
icing generally causes the largest aircraft performance 
penalties in terms of loss in aircraft
lift, and increase in aircraft drag. Depending on
icing rates under these conditions, aircraft drag
can increase measurably in relatively short
periods of time (less than 30 min) with attendant
losses in climb rate and/or engine out capability.
Aircraft with many non-deiceable components such as 
struts, landing gear, hinge brackets, antennae, 
and other small protuberances as are found Lewis icing research
aircraft, can retain 50 - 60 percent of the total accumulated 
drag even after deicing the wing and tail group.  </p>
<p>Rime icing which generally occurs at lower
total air temperatures below freezing, results in
smoother, more pointed ice formations facing the
airstream. This type of icing generally causes
much lower lift and drag penalties as compared to
similar amounts of glaze ice. This result is
illustrate by comparing a rime icing research
flight (83-11) to a glaze icing research flight
(83-10) where approximately the same LWC's were
encountered at the same airspeeds. Even though
Flight 83-11 encountered icing 77 percent longer
than Flight 83-10, the drag increase for Flight
83-11 was only one-third as great as that measured
on Flight 83-10.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract  </p>
<p>Ice formations caused by impingement of large
drizzle droplets and/or runback ice occurring at
temperatures near freezing aft of the normal ice
protected aircraft surfaces have resulted in serious
aerodynamic and control surfaces performance
losses. A solution to these problems is a new
supplemental ice protection installed beyond the
existing protected areas. This retrofit installation is
easily achieved by a new, lightweight, and efficient
electrothermal deicing system consisting of a
conductive matrix laminate bonded to any surface
using standard aircraft materials.  </p>
<p>Recent icing wind tunnel test results reported
herein have demonstrated that this new
technology provides ice protection (deice or anti-ice) 
with very low power requirements compared
to earlier electrothermal systems. A full scale wing
with conventional pneumatic boots on the leading
edge was equipped with the new electrothermal
conductive matrix laminate bonded to the surface
aft of the boots. It was also found necessary to
prevent icing to extend the conductive matrix
forward under the inactive rear portion of the
pneumatic boot.</p>
