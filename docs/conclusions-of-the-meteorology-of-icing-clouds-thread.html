<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The most enduring legacy of the NACA publications on icing meteorology is their 
direct influence on the current icing regulations. </p>
<h3>Icing Regulations and NACA publications</h3>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="/conclusions-of-the-meteorological-instruments-thread.html">Conclusions Meteorological Instruments Thread</a>,
only a limited number of NACA publications went directly into determining the 
current Appendix C icing requirements <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-1 Derivation of FAR Icing Standards" src="/images/Derivation of FAR standards.png"> 
<sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  </p>
<p>[As we saw in <a href="/conclusions-of-the-cylinder-thread.html">Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread</a>, 
it is not entirely clear where this figure originally came from.]  </p>
<p>Thus, by the time <a href="/naca-tn-2738.html">NACA-TN-2738</a> was published in 1952, 
all pertinent icing data had been obtained. </p>
<p>Also note that perhaps the most import part, <a href="/naca-tn-1855.html">NACA-TN-1855</a>, 
was complete by 1949. </p>
<p>There were later icing tests and publications 
(see particularly those by Porter Perkins, 
mentioned in <a href="/meteorology-of-icing-clouds.html">Meteorology of Icing Clouds</a>). 
However, they did not appear to have directly influenced the icing regulations. </p>
<p>The process of reaching the current icing regulations in the figure above might appear 
straight-forward, but engineering judgement was applied at several steps along the way. </p>
<h3>Some comments on the regulations</h3>
<p>Jeck <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> discusses the Appendix C drop size boundaries:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Origins of the "Icing Envelopes" in FAR-25, Appendix C  </p>
<p>Information printed on figures 1 and 4 of FAR-25, Appendix C states that
NACA report TN-1855 (Jones and Lewis, 1949) is the source of data for these
envelopes. Within TN-1855 the reader is referred to two earlier reports,
TN-1393 (Lewis, 1947) and TN-1424 (Lewis et al., 1947) for the actual data on
which the "continuous maximum" envelopes are based. Both TN-1393 and TN-1424
show numerous observations of MVDs in the range 7 to 15 μm. In fact, figure 6
of TN-1424 contains a probability curve which shows that 50% of the observed
MVDs are smaller than 13 micrometer! None of these references contain any obvious
statements that 15 micrometer was viewed as the minimum MVD worth consideration.  </p>
<p>However, such conclusions may have arisen implicitly from the discourse in
TN-1393 on the subject of icing forecast problems. On page 16 of that report,
it is proposed that a fixed MVD of 14 μm be assumed for layer clouds in order
to simplify the problem of specifying icing intensities from a knowledge of
cloud type and estimated LWC alone. Also, in a later section (page 22 of
TN-1393) dealing with maximum, continuous LWCs that are likely to occur in
layer clouds, a value of micrometer μm is proposed as a reasonable estimate for MVDs
to be expected concurrently with continuous maximum LWCs of 0.8 g/m3. The
authors then point out that LWCs of 0.5 g/m3 along with MVDs of 25 μm should
be considered as a definite probability in layer clouds too. These
conclusions, coupled with a recollection (page 7 of TN-1393) that severe icing
was observed on the windshield of their C-46 research aircraft with only 0.15
g/m^3 of LWC when the MVD was an unusually large 50 μm, apparently led the
author to stress the potential importance of the larger MVDs because of the
greater collection efficiencies associated with them.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not all the choices made in creating the current icing standards have had 
obvious logic. </p>
<p>Also see Jeck, 2008 <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> for more comments. </p>
<p>Another choice made in creating the icing standards was not including 
freezing rain.  </p>
<h3>Freezing Rain</h3>
<p>For the NACA-TN-1855 class "IV - M Freezing Rain", 
a similar requirement was not incorporated into Appendix C. 
The assumption was apparently that if equipment was protected for other classes of icing, 
then performance might be adequate in freezing rain. 
Status pressure ports were the 
only equipment listed to be considered against freezing rain. 
It was not until 2014 that freezing rain requirements were incorporated into the new 
Appendix O of CFR 14 Part 25 <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.  </p>
<h3>Change from "Duration" to "Distance" to "Extent" in icing</h3>
<p>The nomenclature changed from "Duration":  </p>
<p><a href="/naca-tn-1393.html">NACA-TN-1393</a><br>
<img alt="Figure 13:
A graph of log duration minutes vs. log liquid water content g/m^3.
There is an &quot;estimated probable maximum conditions&quot; line 
from 2.8 g/m^3 at 0.7 minutes to 0.38 g/m^3 at 150 minutes.
There are several &quot;observed values&quot; data points below the line.
The airspeed in noted as 150 miles per hour.
" src="/images/naca-tn-1393/Distance%20effect.png">  </p>
<p>To "Distance":  </p>
<p><a href="/naca-tn-1904.html">NACA-TN-1904</a><br>
<img alt="Figure 5. Estimated maximum values of average liquid-water content to be expected in 
1000 flights encountering icing, assuming that 5 percent of flights encounter cumulous
clouds." src="/images/naca-tn-1904/Figure5.png">  </p>
<p>To "Extent" (on the X-axis label, however, note that the figure title says "Distance"):  </p>
<p><a href="/naca-tn-2306.html">NACA-TN-2306</a><br>
<img alt="Figure 2. Maximum distance flown during 57 icing flights in relation 
to average measured liquid-water content of supercooled stratiform clouds.
" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2306%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<p>This change was not explained. 
It is not clear if it was editorial, 
or if some subtle technical difference was implied. 
The "distance" in the figure title implies to me that 
"extent" was an editorial choice or error, 
not a technical, data driven choice. </p>
<p>NACA-TN-2738 uses "Extent":  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 8. Variation, with horizontal extent, of the factor by which 
values of liquid-water content from the equiprobability charts should 
be multiplied to include the effect of horizontal cloud extent 
for different exceedance probabilities." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2738%2FFigure%208.png">  </p>
<p>The Appendix C regulation uses "Extent":<br>
<img alt="Appendix C Figure 3. Liquid Water Content vs. Cloud Horizontal Extent.
" src="/images%2FAppendix%20C%20Figure%203.png">  </p>
<p>The various distance effects are hard to directly compare, 
as some are shown as a liquid-water content values, 
and some as a liquid-water content factors. 
Also, linear, log-linear, and log-log plots are used, 
with different units for distance or duration. 
Perhaps in a future post (maybe even a thread) we will sort through all that, 
but for now I will say that they are surprising similar in some regards. </p>
<p>While the nomenclature change may seem to be minor, 
there is an effect on interpretation of the regulation. 
AC 20-73 describes an assumption about an extended duration (45 minute) 
hold in icing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another use is to estimate ice buildups on unprotected surfaces during a 45-minute hold. For the 
45-minute hold discussed in section 8 of this AC, use the LWC from Figure 1 of 14 CFR part 25, 
Appendix C at full value. Guidance for the 45-minute hold assumes the conservative case when 
the holding pattern remains within 17.4 nm and the LWC is changed from that shown in Figure 1 
of 14 CFR part 25, Appendix C.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distance traveled during a 45-minute hold for a large transport 
would be much greater than 17.4 nautical miles, 
resulting in a Liquid Water Content Factor of less than 1, 
but the recommendation above is to use a value of 1 anyway.  </p>
<h3>Drop size distributions</h3>
<p>The accuracy of the multicylinder instrument for determining drop size distribution was 
questioned several times (see, for example, <a href="/naca-tn-1904.html">NACA-TN-1904</a>).</p>
<p>I have not seen direct comparisons between a multicylinder and more current instruments 
that can provided detailed drop size spectrum data.  </p>
<p>The multicylinder instrument drop size distribution determination depends on natural icing 
distributions to be something like the idealized Langmuir drop size distributions. 
For at least some cases, this is true. See <a href="/conclusions-of-the-cylinder-thread.html">Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread</a>.  </p>
<p>Nonetheless, advisory material still suggests the use of Langmuir distributions <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.   </p>
<h3>NACA-TN-1855 suggested research tasks</h3>
<p>NACA-TN-1855 suggested six research task to confirm its recommendations. 
These were largely accomplished in NACA-TN-2738.  </p>
<p>However, I could not find if two of the tasks were accomplished:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>3. Obtain flight data to establish drop—size distribution 
   in clouds.  
4. Obtain necessary data in flight through icing clouds for 
   confirmation or modification of the method of assuming adiabatic 
   lifting and no mixing for the calculation of liquid-water content 
   at any level in a cloud.  
</code></pre></div>

<p>Several instruments were assessed in the NACA-era 
(see the <a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">Meteorological Instruments Thread</a>). 
However, none proved to be a satisfactory alternative to the multicylinder 
method for determining drop-size distributions. 
The best alternative at the time was perhaps some form of water drop imaging,
but it would be decades before that was a practical alternative.  </p>
<p>Appendix C does not mention drop-size distribution. 
Advisory Circular AC 20-73A <sup id="fnref2:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> does include the Langmuir drop size distributions, 
and recommends the use of a D distribution. </p>
<p>While I did not find a further evaluation of adiabatic lift theory, 
note that the earlier <a href="/naca-tn-1424.html">NACA-TN-1424</a> figure 4 (shown further below) 
compares an ideal calculation to one that assumes 1/2 or 2/3 of the water condenses, 
and the 1/2 assumption appears to fit layer-type cloud data better. 
Adiabatic lift theory is still used today to estimate maximum cloud liquid water content. 
However, for the simple implementation, the results are often conservatively high 
compared to measured data. 
I suppose that current weather modelling is a much more sophisticated implementation 
of adiabatic lift theory (and a lot of other physics), 
but it is still challenged to calculate accurate LWC values.  </p>
<h3><a name="tracking-lwc-values"></a> Tracking changes in the understanding of LWC values</h3>
<p>As an example of how the understanding of liquid water content (LWC) 
changed over the NACA-era, we will take an example point from Appendix C Figure 1
for "Continuous Maximum (Stratiform Clouds)".   </p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature = 32F, MVD = 15 micrometer, LWC = 0.8 g/m^3 (17.4 nmi extent)  </li>

<p>Different implementations of theory had differing values. 
By 1949, interpretations of test data had arrived at the 
values in Appendix C. 
There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949.  </p>
<p>For yet another data point from 1947, see the Conclusions below.  </p>
<h3>Recent data comparison to Appendix C</h3>
<p>More recent icing data with more recent instrumentation compares well to the 
70+ year-old NACA data.  </p>
<p>Figure 1 of Cober and Isaac <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> is one example. It is copy-righted, but available on-line. 
While not every data point is within the Appendix C envelope, 
the differences have not been viewed as large enough to require revising the Appendix C regulation.  </p>
<p>Also see Jeck, 2008 <sup id="fnref2:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, for results from a database with 28,000 nmi of flight in icing data, 
including NACA-era measurements. 
There are many comparisons that include NACA data, many on a distance basis as in Figure 22 below. 
Jeck also includes proposed revisions to the icing envelopes (that no one has adopted, as far as I know).  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The current Appendix C icing regulations are largely based on NACA flight tests and 
publications that were completed by 1952. </p>
<p>The data and recommendations from the NACA-era have held up remarkably well. 
The Continuous Maximum Icing part of Appendix C has not been revised since CAR 4b <sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> 
was published in 1955, and later incorporated into Appendix C <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>In 1947, William Lewis wrote <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meteorological conditions conducive to aircraft icing 
which are considered to be of most interest to the designer of 
thermal ice-prevention equipment are summarized in table I. The 
two cases are selected of "most probable maximum" and "typical or 
normal" icing conditions. The drop-size distribution has not been 
specified in the table but may be considered uniform for these 
conditions. In addition to the two conditions specified in the 
table, however, the designer should give consideration to the 
possibility of encountering drop sizes larger than 35 microns, 
although with corresponding low liquid-water content.  </p>
<p>As a general conclusion, it is believed that the meteorological 
factors of icing conditions have been sufficiently defined to allow 
the design of thermal ice-prevention equipment on a fundamental 
wet-air basis.  </p>

<p>They are not identical, but I would call them "close enough" to be 
"to be of most interest to the designer of thermal ice-prevention equipment" 
(having designed and tested several thermal systems myself), 
particularly if one had been using the value from Rodert in 1946 <sup id="fnref2:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> of 3 g/m^3. </p>
<p>As William Lewis said in 1969 <sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, we have reviewed the icing criteria used in the design and 
certification of transport aircraft. Although these standards are now 
twenty years old, they are generally consistent with data that have become 
available since their adoption. Since these criteria have stood the test 
of use, and since the total of experience with existing aircraft is more 
comprehensive than any data collecting program, it is suggested that future 
changes in criteria be based primarily on operating experiences rather than 
on meteorological data. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, operating experiences have not required a change to Appendix C Continuous Maximum Icing
(However, the new Appendix O was published in 2014 <sup id="fnref2:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>, and recall Lewis's note in 1947 
"the designer should give consideration to the possibility of encountering drop 
sizes larger than 35 microns").  </p>
<p>There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949. 
Several factors had come together to make that possible. 
A vital need was recognized. 
Multiple agencies were coordinated (NACA, Army Air Force, Weather Bureau, industry, academia). 
Test aircraft with robust ice protection were available (see <a href="/engine-exhaust-heat.html">Engine Exhaust Heat</a>). 
<a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">Improved icing instruments</a> were being developed. </p>
<p>The icing design requirements are another crowning achievement of the NACA-era.  </p>
