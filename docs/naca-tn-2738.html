<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The icing design values in NACA-TN-1855 were found to have an exceedance probability Pe=0.001.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>A rigorous probability analysis of the considerable icing flight test data was conducted.  </li>
<li>The icing design values in NACA-TN-1855 were found to have an exceedance probability Pe=0.001.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Meteorological icing data obtained in flight in the United States
are analyzed statistically and methods are developed for the determination of:  </p>
<p>(1) the various simultaneous combinations of the three basic
icing parameters (liquid-water content, drop diameter, and temperature)
which would have equal probability of being exceeded in flight in any
random icing encounter; and  </p>
<p>(2) the probability of exceeding any specified group of 
values of liquid-water content associated simultaneously
with temperature and drop-diameter values lying within specified ranges.  </p>
<p>The methods are particularly useful in the design of anti-icing equipment 
intended to operate through the United States, to define simultaneous 
combinations of the meteorological variables which could be
encountered, and to ascertain the effectiveness of the equipment in
withstanding the natural icing conditions to which it may be subjected.
In addition, a mathematical basis is provided for the future statistical
analysis of meteorological icing data that might be obtained throughout
the world.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This report is extensive (94 pages), so many details are not covered herein.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The program of research in aircraft ice prevention which has been
conducted by the NACA during the past several years has been directed
primarily toward the development of practical methods for the design of
thermal ice-prevention equipment for various airplane components. Since
a rational ice-prevention design requires a knowledge of the physical
characteristics of icing conditions, an important phase of the research
program has been an investigation of the meteorological conditions conducive to icing.  </p>
<p><strong>The severity of an encounter with icing, conditions is determined
principally by four factors; namely, the liquid-water content, the
diameter of the drops, the temperature, and the horizontal extent of the
conditions.</strong> The meteorological investigation has, therefore, been concerned 
with obtaining measurements of these quantities in a wide variety
of natural icing conditions in order to establish the range and relative 
frequency of occurrence of various values, and combinations of
values, of these quantities.    </p>
<p>During the period 1945 through 1948, a considerable amount of data
was collected by the Ames and Lewis Laboratories. These results, and
discussions of various phases of the investigation, have been reported
in references 1 through 4. All of these results, together with similar
data from observations made by other organizations, were used as a basis
for a listing of estimated maximum icing conditions recommended for consideration 
in the design of anti-icing equipment (reference 5). <strong>The
probable maximum values listed in reference 5 were estimated on the
basis of what was considered a reasonable extrapolation from a limited
amount of data, and the concept of the probability of encountering
various simultaneous combinations of values entered only in a subjective
and qualitative way</strong>.  </p>

<p>In this report, the available data obtained in icing flights in the
United States are analyzed statistically and the results are presented
graphically in two forms.  </p>
<p>In the first form, the results are plotted to
show the various combinations of liquid-water content, drop diameter,
and ambient-air temperature which have equal probability of being
exceeded.  </p>
<p>In the second form, plots are presented to determine the
probability of exceeding any specified value of liquid-water content
under the condition that the value is associated simultaneously with
values of temperature and drop diameter lying within specified intervals.<br>
Both plots are based on preselected values of horizontal extent; however,
methods for estimating values applicable to other horizontal extents are
also presented.</p>

<p>The mathematical functions used to represent the various distributions 
were chosen mainly on the basis of the empirical criterion of
goodness of fit, although theoretical considerations also were given
considerable weight, particularly in the selection of a function to
represent the distribution of maximum values in those cases in which
each item in the distribution is the maximum of a group of observed
values. The function chosen for representing such distributions is one
originated by Dr. E. J. Gumbel (reference 11) to describe a distribution
of extreme values. This function will be referred to hereinafter as
"Gumbel's distribution."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of Results of the Equiprobability Analysis With Results of NACA TN 1855  </p>
<p>Certain values of liquid-water content, drop diameter, and temperature 
were presented in NACA TN 1855 (reference 5) for consideration in
the design of anti-icing equipment. The combinations of meteorological
variables recommended, however, were lacking in one respect, namely, the
probability of occurrence of these particular combinations. Fortunately,
with the aid of the equiprobability curves, some indication of these
probabilities can be obtained when corresponding meteorological conditions are compared.  </p>
<p>Four classes of icing conditions are presented in NACA TN 1855:
I, instantaneous; II intermittent; III, continuous; and IV, freezing
rain. All classes, except IV, are subdivided into two types of icing
conditions, maximum and normal, and are confined to icing conditions
associated with definite cloud formations of characteristic horizontal
extents. Hence, classes I, II, and III are ideal for comparison with
the results which can be obtained from the equiprobability charts
(figs. 3 to 7) and the relations for horizontal extent (fig. 8).  </p>

<p>Note that the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" is 1 at 10 miles for layer clouds.</p>
<p>How the values in Figure 8 were determined is not described. 
The other factors key (LWC, drops size, temperature) have figures 
11 through 26 that describe them in detail, but the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" 
is not detailed. </p>
<p>Appendix C has a similar figure 3. However, the "Liquid Water Content Factor, F" 
is equal to 1 at 17.4 nmi (20 miles). Note that NACA-TN-2738 is cited on figure 3.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Two groups of icing conditions are chosen as a basis for comparison 
between the analysis of this report and NACA TN 185. The first group
consists of icing conditions selected from the probability analysis for
the case of layer-type clouds, with an exceed.ance probability
Of Pe = 0.001. The second group consists of icing conditions for the
case of Pacific coast cumulus, also with an exceedance probability
of 0.001. These two groups are compared, respectively, with classes Ill-N
and II-M from NACA TN 1855. The comparisons are made by determining
values of liquid-water content from figure 4 and figures 3, 5, and 7 for
the various combinations of temperature and drop diameter given in
table I of NACA TN 1855 for class II-M and III-M conditions, respectively.
The three values of liquid-water content obtained from figures 3, 5,
and 7 corresponding to class III-M were averaged by weighting the values
according to the horizontal extent of the region to which they apply.  </p>
<p>The three regions (fig. 1) have area ratios of about 1/8, 2/8, and 5/8
for the Pacific coast, plateau, and eastern regions, respectively; and
these area ratios were used to weight the values of liquid-water content
from the equiprobability charts so that the resulting average values
would be on a comparable basis with the values expressed In NACA TN 1855.
The weighted average values of liquid-water content were corrected by
figure 8 to make them applicable to a horizontal extent of 20 miles, a
figure reasonably applicable to the layer-cloud data of NACA TN 1855.
For class II-M conditions, no correction for horizontal extent was
required because the values in NACA TN 1855 and figure 4 both apply to
3 miles horizontal-cloud extent.  </p>
<p>The results of the comparisons between NACA TN 1855 and the probability 
analysis are shown in tables III and IV for classes II-M and III-M,
respectively. In general, the liquid-water-content values agree quite
closely, except at temperatures of -4 F and below. In this low temperature 
range, the values of liquid-water content derived from the equiprobability 
surfaces are considerably lower than values given in NACA TN 1855.
The reason is that the probability analysis entails some extrapolation in
this temperature range, and so may not provide exactly the correct value
of liquid-water content. On the other hand, the values listed in
NACA TN 1855 are not restricted to actual measurements, and therefore may
not be of precise magnitude. For design purposes, however, the values
given by the probability analysis should be of proper magnitude. In this
regard, it should be noted that the majority of the data utilized in the
probability analysis was taken at comparatively low altitude (13,000 feet),
whereas the temperature range between -4 F and -40 F represents considerably 
higher altitudes (18,000 to 28,000 feet). This difference In altitude
could have some bearing on the accuracy of the probability data, particularly 
at very high altitudes.</p>

<p><img alt="Table IV. COMPARISON OF WEIGHTED-AVERAGE VALUES OF 
LIQUID WATER CONTENT FOR LAYER CLOUDS, Pe = 0.001, 
WITH CORRESPONDING VALUES FOR CONTINUOUS MAXIMUM 
CONDITIONS LISTED IN NACA TN 1855" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-2738%2FTable%20IV.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By a procedure similar to that used in the comparisons for the two
example cases, the correspondence between classes of Icing conditions
represented by the equiprobability charts and other classes of conditions
presented in NACA TN 185 could be ascertained approximately. The correspondence 
for these classes of conditions, and also for the two example
cases, are shown in table V.  </p>
<p>An inspection of table V reveals a consistency between the classes
of design values recommended in NACA TN 1855 and specific values of
exceedance probabilities. Only the instantaneous maximum icing condition 
(Pe = 0.0001) appears to be incongruous with the maximum conditions
in classes II-M and III-M (Pe = 0.001). This apparent incongruity is
directly attributable to the fact that the instantaneous maximum condition 
presented in NACA TN 1855 was calculated for tall tropical cumulus
clouds. Such extremely severe icing conditions would, of course, be
exceeded infrequently as is borne out by the probability analysis.
Another point of interest in regard to table V Is the general order of
magnitude of the exceedance probabilities which are found to apply to
the various classes of icing conditions specified in NACA TN 1855. For
example, any one of the icing conditions listed under class II-M (intermittent 
maximum) or class III-M (continuous maximum) will be exceeded once
in only about a thousand encounters with icing conditions. It is believed
that the icing conditions specified by classes II-M and III-M do not
impose too severe design requirements and, therefore, if the ice-prevention 
system will cope with these conditions, the results of the
probability analysis indicate that satisfactory ice protection would be
provided for the vast majority of icing encounters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Partial Probability Charts  </p>
<p>The partial probability charts essentially provide a rapid means of
determining the approximate probability of exceeding any specified group
of values of liquid-water content associated simultaneously with temperature 
and drop-diameter values lying within specified ranges. Thus, if
an anti-icing component (e.g., unit span of a jet-inlet guide vane) is
designed by the method of reference 16 to withstand a constant values
of weight rate of water-drop impingement Mt, as computed from a particular 
set of values of liquid-water content, temperature, and drop diameter, 
and if other combinations of these same variables are found which
correspond to the same weight rate of drop impingement, then the probability 
of encountering conditions under which the component will not
perform satisfactorily can be determined approximately. The calculation
of this probability can be performed with the aid of the partial probability 
charts (fig. 10).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS  </p>
<p>The equiprobability surfaces and marginal probability calculation
charts presented herein provide, for the United States, a representation
of the data now available on the meteorological factors responsible for
aircraft icing, expressed In terms of the probability of exceeding
various combinations of values of these factors. The usefulness of the
results is limited somewhat by the amount of data available; errors of
measurement, especially at large values of drop diameter; 
nonrepresentativeness of the flight procedures during research flights; and limited
altitude and geographical extent of the research flight program.
In spite of these limitations, <strong>the probability analysis presented
does provide an indication, heretofore unavailable, of the combinations
of icing conditions having equal probability</strong> of being exceeded in the
United States, and also the probability of exceeding a special set of
icing conditions. Also, a procedure has been established for the statistical 
analysis of future icing meteorological data obtained on a
world-wide basis.  </p>

<p>[Emphasis added.]  </p>
<p>The methods are quite tedious to use. 
They are also quite tedious to implement in a program. 
I doubt that the methods have been used much. 
I perused the 38 citations of NACA-TN-2738 and 
I did not find one that used the calculation method, 
they do cite the results and conclusions.  </p>
<p>The enduring part of NACA-TN-2738 is the confirmation that the 
sometimes "qualitative" or estimated parts of the 
icing values in NACA-TN-1855 represent something close to a more rigorously 
determined equiprobability surface with Pe=0.001. </p>
<p>Jeck <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> comments about NACA-TN-2738 ([5] in Jeck):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the original data collection flights were only in winter and spring icing conditions over
parts of the United States, the existing curves appear to represent all-season stratiform and
convective icing conditions (excluding freezing rain and freezing drizzle) for the United States
and Europe. They enclose about 99% of all measurements obtained by the research flights of the
1940s [12]. A mathematical evaluation in 1952 [5] showed that this “was roughly equivalent to
a probability of 1/1000 that all three variables (LWC, MVD, and OAT) represented by a single
point (in figure 1) would be exceeded simultaneously.” The LWC curves themselves, however,
are thought to represent the 99th percentile value of LWC for a given MVD and OAT. No other
evaluations of the envelopes have since been published.  </p>
