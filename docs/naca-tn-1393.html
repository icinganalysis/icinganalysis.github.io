<h3>"The rotating-cylinder method of measuring liquid water content is generally regarded as being the most accurate and dependable procedure thus far developed"</h3>
</blockquote>
<h1>“A Flight Investigation of the Meteorological Conditions Conducive to the Formation of Ice on Airplanes"</h1>
<p><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A multicylinder and other instruments measure natural icing conditions in flight.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The accuracy of multicylinder instruments used to determine liquid water content and median water drop size is assessed.</li>
<li>An icing intensity index as related to the ice growth rate on a 3 inch diameter cylinder is detailed.</li>
<li>Results from agree well with the Python implementation of the cylinder analysis.</li>
<li>"Tentative" values for icing design conditions were determined.</li>
<li>An effect of distance on icing conditions is noted.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Data from flight measurements of the meteorological factors
related to the intensity of icing conditions are presented. The
physical factors that establish the distribution of liquid water in
clouds of various types are discussed and the results of the analysis
aro used to formulate certain rules for the forecasting of icing
intensity. The problems of determining the range of values of the
significant factors defining icing intensity for the purpose of the
design of ice-protection equipment are discussed, and tentative values
are given.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Multicylinder instruments</h3>
<p>Multi-cylinder probes were used to determine water drop sizes, and, in some cases, drop size distributions.<br>
A fixed cylinder was also used for an "area of catch" method of drop size determination.</p>
<p>The multicylinder method for liquid water content measurement is regarded as accurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rotating-cylinder method of measuring liquid water content is generally regarded as being the most accurate 
 and dependable procedure thus far developed. (Reference 8) <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the multicylinder calculations NACA-TN-1393 cites the methods of Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An assessment of the accuracy of the rotating cylinder method is included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The errors involved in calculating the liquid water content
and mean-effective diameter from the two-cylinder-data have been
estimated by considering the errors inherent in measuring the
quantities-used in the calculations.. The results, which are shown
in the following table, are based on a liquld water content of 0.5
gram per cubic meter and an average drop diameter of 10 microns.</p>

<p>Part of the challenge of reproducing prior results is the terse descriptions of the differing conditions used describe the line item. 
For the 'Error due to using "C" distribution curves for unknown distribution' item, 
I calculated the cylinder masses with each of Langmuir A, B, C, D, E distributions and then 
calculated a best fit assuming a Langmuir C distribution. 
This may or may not be what NACA-TN-1393 actually did. 
The results are shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="Median Effective Drop Diameter vs. LWC assuming a Langmuir C distribution" src="images/naca-tn-1393/naca_tn_1393_error_assuming_c.png"></p>
<p>If the distribution was actually a Langmuir E, but we assumed a Langmuir C, 
the difference in calculated mean effective drop diameter is 7%.</p>
<p>Note also that calculated LWC values differ, except when the assumed and acutal distributions are both Langmuir C. 
As the drop size is different, the collection efficiency is different, 
and to maintain the same mass the LWC must differ.</p>
<h3>Icing intensity index</h3>
<p>Icing intensity definitions from "reference 12" <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> are included.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of icing intensity- It is now generally recognized 
that the principal factors determining the intensity of an
icing condition are the concentration of super-cooled liquid water 
and the diameter of the drops. In addition, when thermal methods 
of de-icing are considered, the air temperature and the amount of
snow in the air have an important effect upon the heat requirements.
Icing intensities have been defined by the U.S. Weather Bureau for
reports from mountain stations in terms of the rate of collection 
at 200 miles per hour on a 3-inch-diameter circular cylinder,
expressed as grams per hour per square centimeter of projected area.
(See reference 12.) The definitions are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Trace ice: 0 to 1.0 grams per square centimeter hour  
Light ice: 1.0 to 6.0 grams per square centimeter hour  
Moderate ice: 6.0 to 12.O grams per square centimeter hour  
Heavy ice: 12.0 and over grams per square centimeter hour
</code></pre></div>

<p>The icing intensity definitions and cylinder water catch calculations from <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> were used to make Figure 5.
<img alt="Figure 5: a graph of Mean effective drop diameter in microns vs. Liquid water content in g/m^3. 
Lines for the intensity values 1, 6, and 12 g/cm^2-h are shown,
as well as several flight meaasurement values" src="images/naca-tn-1393/Figure%205.png"></p>
<h3>Comparison of impingement results</h3>
<p>When I overlaid calculations with the implementation of the cylinder impingement calculations <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> 
the results agreed quite well (the underlying pdf image of Figure 5 is slightly distorted). </p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of Figure 5 to results from the Python tool" src="images/naca-tn-1393/compare.png"></p>
<p>The code used to make the figure is available in the file "naca-tn-1393.py" <sup id="fnref2:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Illustrating water drop size distributions</h3>
<p>Figure 10 below illustrates a challenge when comparing Langmuir drop size distributions to other, measured distributions. 
There are 7 bins in a Langmuir distribution.
The figure has "stair steps" plotted to illustrate the cumulative distribution.
The "B" distribution appear to compare favorably with the "observed distribution", 
but with limitations due to the discrete nature of the Langmuir distributions. 
At the volume median drop diameter the vertical line jumps from 35 to 65 "percent of water in drop smaller than d".</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 16: a graph of Mean effective drop diameter in microns vs. 
Percent of water in drops smaller than d.
An &quot;observed distribution&quot; line from &quot;reference 8&quot; forms an increasing &quot;S&quot; curve.
A Langmuir &quot;B&quot; distribution approximates the observed distribution,
while a Langmuir &quot;E&quot; distriubtion is notable wider." src="images/naca-tn-1393/distributions.png"></p>
<h3>"Tentative" Design Values</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis of the available observational data, supplemented by
considerations of the physical processes involved in the formation
of icing conditions has led to the following tentative estimates of
the most severe icing conditions likely to be encountered in the 
course of all-weather transport operations in the United States:</p>

<h3>Distance effect</h3>
<p>It was noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The duration of flight in 
continuous icing was therefore used as a measure of the extent of
the conditions although in several cases the airplane was flown back
and forth in a single cloud formation thus giving rise to larger
duration than would have been required for a straight flight.
Figure 13 shows the relation between the duration of periods of flight
in continuous icing conditions and the average liquid water content
during the periods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 13:
A graph of log duration minutes vs. log liquid water content g/m^3.
There is an &quot;estimated probable maximum conditions&quot; line 
from 2.8 g/m^3 at 0.7 minutes to 0.38 g/m^3 at 150 minutes.
There are several &quot;observed values&quot; data points below the line.
The airspeed in noted as 150 miles per hour.
