</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h3>Types of ice shapes</h3>
<p>As ice accumulates on a wing, it changes the shape of the airfoil. 
The ice that forms is sometimes called an <a href="/terminology.html#ice-accretion">"Ice accretion"</a> in the literature. 
The shape of the ice depends on details of the flight and icing conditions.  </p>
<p><a name="figure-glaze-ice"></a>
At warmer temperatures (about -10°C to 0°C, depending on airspeed and other factors), 
ice shapes tend to produce <a href="/terminology.html#glaze-ice">"Glaze Ice"</a> shapes with "horns". 
The nomenclature varies by domain. 
Pilot training materials generally note this type of ice as "Clear Ice".  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-1. Clear or glaze ice forms on the leading edge of an airfoil, sometimes following the contour of the airfoil. 
Sometimes prominent &quot;horns&quot; also form." src="/images%2FAC-91-74B%2FFigure%203-1.png">   </p>
<p><em>from "Pilot Guide: Flight in Icing Conditions", AC 91-74B <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91-74B.pdf">faa.gov</a></em>  </p>
<p><a name="figure-rime-ice"></a>
At colder temperatures, the ice appears milky and opaque, and is termed <a href="/terminology.html#rime-ice">"Rime Ice"</a>.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-3. Rime ice forms on the leading edge of an airfoil." src="/images%2FAC-91-74B%2FFigure%203-3.png"><br>
<em>from "Pilot Guide: Flight in Icing Conditions", AC 91-74B <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91-74B.pdf">faa.gov</a></em>  </p>
<p><a name="figure-mixed-ice"></a>
At temperatures in between, <a href="/terminology.html#mixed-ice">"Mixed Ice"</a> can form.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-4. Mixed ice forms on the leading edge of an airfoil" src="/images%2FAC-91-74B%2FFigure%203-4.png"><br>

<p>These types of ice can have varying effects on lift and drag. </p>
<p>The <a href="/resources.html#FAA-H-8083-28">FAA-H-8083-28</a>, "Aviation Weather Handbook" says of clear or glaze 
ice can be the most hazardous form:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clear icing is a more hazardous ice type for many reasons.</strong> 
It tends to form horns near the top and bottom of the airfoils’ 
leading edge, which greatly affects airflow. This results in 
an area of disrupted and turbulent airflow that is considerably 
larger than that caused by rime ice. Since it is clear and 
difficult to see, the pilot may not be able to quickly recognize 
that it is occurring. It can be difficult to remove since it can 
spread beyond the deicing or anti-icing equipment, although in 
most cases, it is removed nearly completely by deicing devices.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aircraft features smaller than wings, 
such as engine components, antennas, and air data probes, 
generally have a high collection efficiency, regardless of drop size, 
and can have ice accretions that are a large fraction of the 
feature size. </p>

<p>Ice shapes on swept wings can have complex "lobster tail" shapes:  </p>

<h3>The thermodynamics of freezing</h3>
<p>For liquid water to freeze, heat must flow out of the water. 
A term for the amount of heat is the <a href="/terminology.html#latent-heat">"Latent Heat of Fusion"</a>. 
The latent heat value is about 334 kJ/kg. 
This is much higher than the energy required to cool the water by 1°C (1 kJ/kg). </p>
<p>While supercooled water drops in the atmosphere are below 0°C, 
the latent heat release and other energy sources tend to raise an aircraft surface temperature to 0°C 
when water drop impinge on the surface and freeze. </p>
<p>The <a href="/terminology.html#messinger">"Messinger Heat Balance"</a> (from Bernard Messinger in 1951)
considers several ways heat enters and leaves a surface in flight with water on it. 
A large term is the latent heat of freezing. 
Convection heat transfer (the transfer of heat from the surface to the atmosphere due to the motion of air) is a factor considered.
Water on the surface can evaporate, and the <a href="/terminology.html#evaporation">"Evaporation"</a> rate is sensitive to air pressure. 
Evaporation greatly aids the freezing process, 
as the latent heat of evaporation is almost seven times (2256 kJ/kg) that of the latent heat of freezing, 
and in opposite sense (freezing produces heat to be removed, evaporation results in cooling). 
Much detailed data, including the <a href="/terminology.html#water-catch">"Water catch"</a> rate, 
is required to perform the Messinger heat balance. </p>
<p>One term that the Messinger heat balance produces is a <a href="/terminology.html#freezing-fraction">"Freezing Fraction"</a>, 
the fraction of impinging water that freezes. 
This can be related to the over-all character of ice shapes. </p>
<p>Here, freezing fraction ("relatively slow freezing") is related to ice type: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clear ice (or glaze ice) is a glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large, 
supercooled water droplets. Clear icing conditions exist more often in an environment with warmer 
temperatures, higher liquid water contents, and larger droplets.<br>

Terms of the Messinger heat balance:  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Icing energy heat balance from a presentation by Bernard Messinger." src="/images%2Fmessinger%2FFigure1.png"><br>

<p>Calculations to relate ice shape to freezing fraction have many variables. 
Here is a figure that summarizes the effects of some variables
(n is calculated freezing fraction):  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2-81. Ice shape types as a function of speed and ambient temperature for a liquid water content of 0.2 g/m^3.

<p>Note that at a high enough airspeed, there is a wide range of 
temperatures that are predicted to not result in ice 
(n = freezing fraction = 0).  </p>

<p>"Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a>, 
Chapter 1, Section 2 in particular.<br>
Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a> The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.</p>
