<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1 BACKGROUND  </p>
<p>The formation of ice on aircraft surfaces occurs during flight through supercooled
droplets. Ice accretions on these surfaces usually degrade both aircraft performance and
operational safety. For this reason, it has become important in the design and certification
phases of system development to evaluate system performance degradation because of icing.</p>
<p>The most acceptable method of evaluating the performance characteristics of aircraft
and aircraft components for system certification would be to conduct flight tests in natural
icing conditions. Adequate system evaluation through icing flight tests requires specific
weather conditions, posing severe operational limitations because of the low frequency of
their occurrence. This makes certification through flight testing time consuming and
expensive because large amounts of flying time are required to adequately evaluate a system
over a wide range of conditions. Flight testing in a simulated cloud produced by an icing
tanker would appear to be the next most desirable method of conducting icing tests. In
practice, this method of flight testing is severely limited by tanker operational limitations,
lack of control of atmospheric parameters such as temperature, pressure and humidity, and
the logistics of maintaining steady flight in a cloud produced by a leading aircraft.
Therefore, ground testing in altitude facilities has become an accepted approach for
evaluating aircraft system performance in icing conditions.</p>
<p>The size of many of the aircraft components to be tested greatly limits the number of test
facilities capable of conducting icing tests. It would be beneficial to the icing community if
the feasibility of using scale models in these tests could be proven. The problem is
complicated because the icing process is governed by the impingement of water droplets and
the thermodynamics of the freezing process on the surface. This document gives the results
of a study conducted at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) Engine Test
Facility (ETF) to experimentally verify a set of icing scaling equations.  </p>
<p>1.2 SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION  </p>
<p>A research program was conducted at the AEDC/ETF to evaluate the icing scaling
requirements. The objectives of the study were (1) to evaluate the equations governing the
icing process to identify proposed scaling parameters, (2) to develop a computer code to
solve the various forms of the icing scaling equations, (3) to conduct tests to determine
which, if any, of the proposed methods produced scale ice accretions, and (4) if an accurate
set of icing scaling equations were found, to write a final computer code that could be used
in icing tests.  </p>
<p>The scaling verification tests were conducted using full- and half-scale circular cylinders
and full-, 1/3-, and 1/6-scale airfoil sections. By applying a postulated scaling method, test
conditions that should produce scale ice accretions were calculated using the computer code
developed for this study. The size and shape of the ice accretions resulting from these test
conditions were compared with full-scale results to determine the accuracy of the scaling
method. The objectives of the study were met by identifying a scaling method that produces
scaled ice accretions over a wide range of test conditions and that can be applied to a variety
of icing testing situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is a long publication (80 pages, 38 figures), so this will be a highly condensed review. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>TYPES OF ICING SCALING  </p>
<p>The first and most obvious type of icing scaling is that in which the ice accretions are
formed on a subscale model similar to those that would be obtained at full-scale. The ability
to test subscale geometries would allow smaller test facilities to conduct a wider range of
icing tests. Since smaller test facilities are usually less expensive to operate than larger
facilities, the cost would be substantially reduced.  </p>
<p>A second type of icing scaling, test parameter scaling, is aimed at increasing the
simulation capabilities of test facilities by extending the Mach number, altitude, and/or
temperature ranges. Icing scaling equations relate the test cell atmospheric and
meteorological conditions so that similar ice accretions can be formed. These equations
indicate how ground test conditions could be modified to avoid the operational limits of a
test facility, yet achieve the appropriate icing condition. For example, a facility may be
limited to ambient pressure but have the need to produce an ice accretion that would be
formed at an altitude of 10,000 ft. The scaling equations would be applied to determine the
test conditions at atmospheric pressure required to simulate the icing that occurs at the
altitude flight condition. This type of scaling will allow test facilities to offer a wider range of
possible conditions to an aircraft manufacturer to evaluate their flight system.  </p>
<p>The applications of both types of scaling would make them very attractive to both the
test facility operator and the aircraft manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several candidate similarity terms are developed. </p>
<h3>Impingement similarity</h3>
<p>Water drop impingement similarity is used, similar to <a href="/scaling-in-naca-icing-wind-tunnel-tests.html">NACA-RM-E8A27</a>, 
but rather than separate K and Phi terms, a merged Ko term is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K = 2/9 ρ<sub>w</sub> r<sub>d</sub><sup>^2 </sup>U<sub>∞</sub>/(μ<sub>a</sub> c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</p>
<p>Ko = (λ/λ<sub>s</sub>) K  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)</p>
<p>Where:<br>
ρ<sub>w</sub> is water density<br>
r<sub>d</sub> is drop diameter radius<br>
U<sub>∞</sub> is free stream air speed<br>
μ<sub>a</sub> is air viscosity<br>
c is chord length  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These and λ/λ<sub>s</sub> we saw in <a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Langmuir and Blodgett</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Water exposure similarity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A<sub>c</sub> = LWC(U<sub>∞</sub>)τ / (ρ<sub>w</sub>c)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (16)</p>
<p>Where:
A<sub>c</sub> is the accumulation parameter<br>
LWC is the liquid water content<br>
U<sub>∞</sub> is free stream air speed<br>
τ is time in icing<br>
ρ<sub>w</sub> is water density<br>
c is chord length<br>
T<sub>s</sub> is air static temperature  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Freezing similarity</h3>
<p>A heat transfer analysis derived from Messinger <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> was developed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b = W<sub>w</sub>c<sub>p<sub>ws</sub></sub> / h<sub>c</sub>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (20)<br>
Φ = 32 - T<sub>s</sub> - U<sub>∞</sub><sup>^2</sup>/(2 g<sub>c</sub> J c<sub>p<sub>w,s</sub></sub>)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (21)<br>
Θ = (T<sub>sur</sub> - T<sub>s</sub> - U<sub>∞</sub><sup>^2</sup>/(2 g<sub>c</sub> J c<sub>p<sub>a</sub></sub>)) + W<sub>e</sub> L<sub>v</sub> / h<sub>c</sub>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (22)  </p>
<p>Where:<br>
W<sub>w</sub> is water catch rate<br>
c is chord length<br>
c<sub>p<sub>ws</sub></sub> is the specific heat of water on the surface<br>
h<sub>c</sub> is heat transfer coefficient<br>
T<sub>s</sub> is air static temperature<br>
U<sub>∞</sub> is free stream air speed<br>
g<sub>c</sub> is a unit system constant<br>
J is the unit system work to thermal energy factor
32 is the ice melting point temperature in Fahrenheit
T<sub>sur</sub> is surface temperature<br>
c<sub>p<sub>a</sub></sub> is the specific heat of water on the surface<br>
W<sub>e</sub> is the rate of surface water evaporation<br>
L<sub>v</sub> is the latent heat of evaporation of water</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The g<sub>c</sub> and J terms are explained further in <a href="/a-brief-digression-on-unit-systems.html">A Brief Digression on Unit Systems</a>. </p>
<p>W<sub>e</sub> is explained further in Appendix B of AEDC-TR-85-30. </p>
<p>While it was not explicitly noted in AEDC-TR-85-30, note that:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>n = (c<sub>p<sub>w,s</sub></sub>/L<sub>v</sub>) (Φ + Θ / b)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if Φ, Θ, and b are matched then n will be matched. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the following scaling equations will be evaluated in the experimental
portion of this study:</p>
<p>(K<sub>o</sub>)<sub>model</sub> = (K<sub>o</sub>)<sub>full-scale</sub><br>
(A<sub>c</sub>)<sub>model</sub> = (A<sub>c</sub>)<sub>full-scale</sub><br>
(n)<sub>model</sub> = (n)<sub>full-scale</sub><br>
(b)<sub>model</sub> = (b)<sub>full-scale</sub><br>
(Φ)<sub>model</sub> = (Φ)<sub>full-scale</sub><br>
(Θ)<sub>model</sub> = (Θ)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have read two of these in the past (but I do not have a copy of them), 
and I have not found any of these online. 
It is not surprising that the one from Lockheed Aircraft includes freezing fraction,

<h3>Icing wind tunnel tests</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>These results have identified a scaling procedure that accurately duplicates the 
ice-accretion profiles. In this scaling method, Ko, Ac, n, Φ, and Θ are held constant. 
The set of verified scaling equations can, therefore, be expressed as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>(K<sub>o</sub>)<sub>model</sub> = (K<sub>o</sub>)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </li>
<li>(A<sub>c</sub>)<sub>model</sub> = (A<sub>c</sub>)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </li>
<li>(n)<sub>model</sub> = (n)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </li>
<li>(Φ)<sub>model</sub> = (Φ)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </li>
<li>(Θ)<sub>model</sub> = (Θ)<sub>full-scale</sub>  </li>
</ol>
<p>A final version of the icing scaling similitude code, SIMICE, was written to solve the
above set of verified scaling equations (See AEDC-TR-85-30, Vol. II). The icing test
parameters that must be determined from these equations are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>velocity  </li>
<li>static pressure  </li>
<li>static temperature  </li>
<li>liquid water content</li>
<li>drop diameter</li>
<li>icing time  </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I have not been able to find "AEDC-TR-85-30, Vol. II", or the SIMICE program online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that there are six icing test parameters and only five equations, indicating that the
problem is underspecified and that one of the test parameters can, therefore, be arbitrarily
selected. In practice, this additional parameter is selected to overcome a test facility
limitation. The solution of the above equations will be illustrated by two practical scaling
examples to be discussed in the following section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note also that some icing wind tunnels do not control pressure. 
In those cases, the five equations determine the five test parameters. </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>8.0 SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the equations governing the ice-accretion
process to identify proposed scaling parameters and to conduct tests to determine which, if
any, of the proposed methods produced scale ice accretions. A set of scaling equations were
verified, and limitations of the scaling techniques were identified. A computer code was
developed to solve the scaling equations for use in various icing applications. The results of
this study can be summarized as follows:<br>
1. A set of equations that can be used to calculate test conditions so that scaled ice
shapes are produced on geometrically similar bodies was developed and
experimentally verified. The test conditions are such that Ko, Ac, n, Φ, and 0, are
held constant.<br>
2. The post-test evaluation of the scaling parameters based on the actual test conditions
was necessary for the accurate evaluation of test results.<br>
3. An icing similitude computer code, SIMICE, was developed to calculate similitude
conditions using the verified scaling equations.<br>
4. The equations are applicable over the range of meteorological conditions found in
natural icing, with the possible exception of velocity.<br>
5. Velocity is the primary limitation of the scaling equations. To maintain scaled flow
fields and droplet impingement characteristics, both the model and full-scale
velocities must yield a Reynolds number greater than or equal to 2.0 x 10^5 and less
than the velocity giving the critical Mach number of the body geometry.<br>
6. At values of dynamic pressure of approximately 1.6 psia, the shedding
characteristics of the ice accretion were observed to effect the final ice shape.
Therefore, ice accretions did not scale well when qf &gt; 1.6 psia and qm &lt; 1.6 or vice
versa.<br>
7. A method for scaling shedding characteristics by maintaining the dynamic pressure
was developed, but facility limitations did not permit adequate verification.
Additional testing is required to verify this ice-shedding scaling technique.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The selected method yielded excellent results.</p>
<p>In later literature, it is sometimes called the "AEDC" or "Ruff" method. </p>
<p>The method can be rather restrictive, 
particularly if adjusting test section air pressure is not available. 
Depending on the flight reference condition, 
the calculated test condition may be outside of the envelope of 
MVD-LWC-Airspeed that the facility can produce (a subject not covered in AEDC-TR-85-30).</p>
