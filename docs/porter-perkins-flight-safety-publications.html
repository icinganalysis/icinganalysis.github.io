<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Three publications on flight safety by Porter Perkins are reviewed.  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>These publications are copyrighted. 
The first one, however, has a reuse license, and so much of the discussion will center on it.</p>
<h2>"Tailplane icing and aircraft performance degradation" 1992 <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Ice on the tailplane (horizontal stabilizer) was identified as a risk on some aircraft:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the sensitivity of airplanes to inflight icing has
been recognized for many years and can be minimized by
ice protection systems, the advent of the medium-altitude
turboprop commuter transport aircraft has resulted in
renewed attention to the icing problem. This review of
icing has been prompted by several recent accidents that
apparently were caused by an oversensitivity to ice buildup
on the horizontal stabilizer of these aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a coordinated effort to reduce risks due to tailplane icing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stall Can Be Caused by Ice On Tail Surfaces  </p>
<p>A joint U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA)/FAA International
Tailplane Icing Workshop to address this
problem was held November 4-5, 1991, at
the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio,
U.S. Approximately 100 representatives from manufacturers, 
key special interest groups and airworthiness authorities 
of Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and
the United States attended. The problem of horizontal
tailplane stall caused by ice accretions also has been
studied by the Swedish-Soviet Working Group in the
Field of Flight Safety.</p>
<p><img alt="Ice can form on tailplanes and antennas faster than on wings." src="/images%2FAccident%20Prevention%20Feb%201992%2FFigure%20tailplane.png"><br>
Ice accretion shape is a result of the rate of freezing on
the surface. Low temperatures and droplet impingement
rates (water concentration X velocity), along with small
droplets, promote rapid freezing on the surface. Such
conditions produce a rather smooth ice surface and pointed
accretion shape called rime ice. However, temperatures
near freezing, higher rates of accretion and larger droplet
sizes result in delays in freezing when the droplets strike
the surface. These conditions create irregular ice formations 
with flat or concave surfaces sometimes having
protuberances (“double-horn” ice formation) facing the
airstream either side of the airflow center or stagnation
line. This type of ice formation is usually described as
glaze ice.  </p>
<p>Ice shapes are of extreme importance because the contour,
roughness and location of the
ice formation on the various
aircraft components can significantly deteriorate aerodynamic performance. Glaze
ice shapes, runback ice
(formed when water droplets
flow in liquid form to freeze
on a colder region of the airfoil) and ice caused by freezing rain (large droplets that
do not follow the airflow but
form ice on all surfaces they
strike) can produce significant aerodynamic penalties
by decreasing lift and stall
angle and increasing drag and
stall speed. This is caused
by the ice destroying the aerodynamics necessary for peak
airfoil performance.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flight physics can make some phases of flight have a higher risk:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the aircraft slows after flap extension,
the requirement for downward lift by the
horizontal tail increases to increase the angle
of attack of the wing and produce a given
amount of lift at a slower speed. With flaps
full down and the aircraft at approach speeds,
the angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer 
is very high. It is high also because of
the downwash over the tail created by the
extended flaps. This will increase the angle
of attack of the stabilizer even more.  </p>
<p>This situation is where tailplane ice can cause trouble. A
small amount of ice contamination on the leading edge of
the horizontal stabilizer can interfere with the airflow on
the underside of the stabilizer because it may be working
near its maximum angle of attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some incidents had common characteristics:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generally, the tailplane stall problem that has been presented 
here seems to be associated with aircraft which
have the following characteristics. They:<br>
• Do not have powered control surfaces, and rely on
aerodynamic balance to keep stick forces low;<br>
• Have high efficiency flaps that produce relatively<br>
• Have non-trimmable stabilizers;<br>
• Have efficient stabilizers with short chord length
and small leading edge radii; and,<br>
• Mostly have inflatable boots for ice protection.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the NASA/FAA workshop was
the recognition of the need for more education and training 
for pilots. This workshop recognized that much
training, both initial and recurrent, has been provided for
recognition and proper actions related to windshear; however,
crew training for operations in icing conditions have
been emphasized less. Some of the current recommended
procedures suggested during crew training (e.g., increased
airspeed) may actually exacerbate an already adverse
situation at the horizontal tail.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>"Aircraft icing problems-After 50 years.", 1993 <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract  </p>
<p>Although solutions to the aircraft icing
phenomenon have been pursued for over 50
years, involving thousands of people, resulting in
the availability of improved ice protection
systems, fatal accidents caused by ice on critical
aircraft components continue to plague aviation.
We believe the rate of accidents caused by ice
can be reduced if aviation safety is focussed on
three key issues; pilot training, concurrent
development of increased ice protection, and
identification and codification of new regulations.
With the possible exception of the hazards
associated with tailplane ice, our knowledge of
aircraft icing and the penalties associated with it
has not changed substantially in the last forty to
fifty years. Design criteria, hardware, and flight
procedures have been in place for many years to
enable safe flight In most icing environments. In
addition, meteorological data is widely available
so that well trained aircrews can make decisions
to avoid areas where protection from icing Is
questionable or not possible. Key issue is pilot
training. Most, if not all of the recent accidents
on record having icing as the probable cause
could have been prevented if the flight crews
understood the serious nature of the situation
and had applied appropriate corrective action.</p>

<h2>"Contending with Airframe Icing", 2002 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT  </p>
<p>Pilots need to be aware, under certain icing conditions,
of the limitations of ice protection on their particular
aircraft. FAA certification for flight into known icing does
not ensure complete safety of flight in all icing
encounters regardless of skills or aircraft capability. Too
many accidents where icing was a contributing factor
attest to these facts. Most of the time flight crews will not
encounter an extremely severe condition. However, icing
conditions are so widely variable that by chance they will
encounter a condition in which they are unprepared.
Many years of flight research in icing by the authors
have provided the opportunity to experience and
measure a wide range of icing conditions in which the
performance losses and flying qualities of the aircraft
were determined. These results are described in this
paper.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Figure 1, "Various Ice Accretion Shapes Observed In Icing Research Flight Program", is quite interesting, but copyrighted, so it will not be reprinted here. 
It classifies ice shapes not in just the usually three types (rime, glaze, and mixed), but into ten types.  </p>
<p>Some figures came from Perkin's earlier works, reviewed in <a href="/meteorology-publications-by-porter-perkins.html">Meteorology publications by Porter Perkins</a>: </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The flight crew training recommendations noted above in part resulted in a 
<a href="https://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/">NASA Aircraft Icing Training</a> 
series. These are focussed on pilots' needs, but are accessible to anyone interested in aircraft icing. </p>
<p>Flight safety is an ongoing effort. 
For example, while large drop icing conditions such as freezing rain were noted in many of Perkins works, 
including "Tailplane icing and aircraft performance degradation" above, 
the air transport system as a whole (regulators, airline, manufacturers, pilots, etc.) 
did not entirely realize the importance of those conditions until an accident in 1994 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. 
The official accident reports are not easy to read <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>, but are highly recommended. 
That accident set a number of efforts into effect, including new regulations <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>
