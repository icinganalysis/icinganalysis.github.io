</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The good news is that these resources comprise thousands of pages of reading.<br>
The bad news is that these comprise thousands of pages of reading. </p>
<p>A few experts that I know have confessed that they have not read all of 
what I consider to be "The Big Three", let alone everything listed here. 
So, you can probably get along by not reading everything. </p>
<p>Most of the resources are online and available at no cost. 
Some are copyrighted, and available for purchase or online access rental. 
Your local library may be able to borrow some of them for you through inter-library loan. </p>
<h2 id="ADS4">The Big Three</h2>
<p>These total to over 800 pages (over 1200 if one counts all three volumes of DOT/FAA/CT-88/8), 
but they can give you broad exposure to aircraft icing technology. 
However, they are now a little dated (the most recent, DOT/FAA/CT-88/8, was updated in 1993).  </p>
<p>If I had to pick only one, it would be DOT/FAA/CT-88/8.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data", ADS-4 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0608865">apps.dtic.mil</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The "Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a><br>
Also note that there was a perhaps little known update in 1993: <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a><br>
The update contains only the updated pages. 
This worked fine when one printed the pages, punched holes, and manually substituted them into a three ring binder, 
but not so well in the digital age. 
I do not know of a pdf file that integrates the two into one.<br>
Also note that there are 3 volumes:<br>
"Aircraft Icing Handbook Volume 2", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-2. <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238040.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a><br>
"Aircraft Icing Handbook Volume 3", DOT/FAA/C-88/8-3. <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA2380410">apps.dtic.mil</a><br>
Some pages in Volume 3 are affected by the update noted above.<br>

Chapter 20 covers icing. This consolidates some prior publications:  <blockquote>
<p>This handbook consolidates the weather information from the following 
advisory circulars (AC) into one source document. By doing this, 
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to streamline access
to the FAA’s weather documentation for users of the National Airspace 
System (NAS). The following ACs will remain in effect, but they will 
eventually be cancelled at a later date following the publication of this
handbook:<br>
• AC 00-6, Aviation Weather.<br>
• AC 00-24, Thunderstorms.<br>

<p>Icing, in general, is any deposit or coating of ice on an object, caused by the impingement and freezing of liquid (usually supercooled) hydrometeors; to be distinguished from hoarfrost in that the latter results from the deposition of water vapor.  </p>

The presentation discusses NASA’s approach to studying the various forms of aircraft icing, which includes conducting flight tests, performing ground-based icing wind tunnel tests, and developing computational tools that simulate the icing physics. An overview on the future of aviation and icing is provided. The presentation is largely high level, but also provides some technical icing physics discussion.  </p>

<h2 id="icing-wind-tunnel">Icing Wind Tunnel Test</h2>
<p>As noted in the post <a href="https://icinganalysis.com/icing-wind-tunnel-test-thread.html">Icing Wind Tunnel Test Thread</a>, 
for icing wind tunnels, unlike regular wind tunnels, there is no comprehensive source of information for their use. </p>

it does illustrate several concepts,

<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>"ALC-33: Inflight Icing" <a href="https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/course_content.aspx?cID=33">faasafety.gov</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite improvements in equipment and forecast technique, inflight icing is a contributing factor in accidents and incidents each year.  What are the reasons for these encounters, and what can you as a pilot do to safely manage the risk associated with icing?<br>
In this course you will learn that water does not always freeze at 32° F. or 0° C. You’ll discover which temperatures are most conducive to clear, rime, and mixed icing, and how water content and droplet size relates to icing severity. You may discover that the de-ice or anti-ice equipment on your aircraft cannot always provide adequate protection. You will find tools for evaluating icing conditions before flight, and you'll have the opportunity to understand and learn how to avoid or, if necessary, recover from roll upset and tail stalls caused by structural ice.  </p>

<h2>More Recent Publications</h2>
<p>Much has been published since the DOT/FAA/CT-88/8 Aircraft Icing Handbook, 
of which Volume III includes an extensive bibliography. 
Publishing an extensive bibliography now would be impractical (on this or almost any topic), 
given the current pace of new information. </p>
<p>Online searches may be the best solution in these times. 
Once you are grounded in The Basics, 
you will know the terminology and be able to better shape you search inquiries. </p>
