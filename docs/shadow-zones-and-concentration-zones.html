<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The concentration of water-drops varies with distance from a surface in flight.  </p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Trajectories of water droplets about an ellipsoid of revolution
with a fineness ratio of 5 (which often approximates the shape of an aircraft
fuselage or missile) were computed with the aid of a differential analyzer. 
Analyses of these trajectories indicate that the local concentration of
liquid water at various points about an ellipsoid varies considerably
and under some conditions may be several times the free-stream concentration.
Curves of the local concentration factor as a function of
spatial position were obtained and are presented in terms of dimensionless 
parameters Reo (free-stream Reynolds
number) and K (inertia), which contain flight and atmospheric conditions.
These curves show that the local concentration factor at any point is
very sensitive to change in the dimensionless parameters Reo and K.
These data indicate that the expected local concentration factors should be
considered when choosing the location of, or when determining anti-icing heat requirements for, 
water- or ice-sensitive devices that protrude
into the stream from an aircraft fuselage or missile. Similarly, the
concentration factor should be considered when choosing the location on
an aircraft of instruments that measure liquid-water content or droplet-size 
distribution in the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>NACA-TN-3135 details an ellipsoid of fineness ratio 5, 
and NACA-TN-3410 details an ellipsoid of fineness ratio 10, and includes comparisons with the other ellipsoid. </p>
<p>These have many similarities to the analyses in <a href="/bodies-of-revolution.html">Bodies of Revolution</a>, 
so readers may wish to review that before proceeding here.</p>
<p><a href="/naca-tn-1424.html">NACA-TN-1424</a> mentioned that the results from multicylinder instruments might be affected by 
the airplane body deflecting water-drop trajectories, and giving distorted values along the length of the instrument 
protruding out from the airplane body. NACA-TN-3153 and NACA-TN-3410 give a way of assessing water drop 
concentrations off of the airplane body. </p>
<p>Most of the discussion and figures will be from NACA-TN-3153, except as noted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
It is generally recognized that an aircraft moving through a cloud
alters the concentration of cloud droplets in the immediate vicinity of
the aircraft. For example, the peculiar distributions of ice often found
on aircraft antenna support arms or on pitot static tubes after flight
through supercooled clouds are indications that the concentration of liquid water 
in the vicinity of the fuselage is considerably altered by the air flow about the fuselage. 
This effect is illustrated by the photographs of figure 1, which show ice formed on instrument support rods
mounted on the side and bottom of the fuselage of a B-25 aircraft during
flight through a supercooled cloud. As indicated by the ice formations
of figure 1, there is frequently a region of reduced (or zero) droplet
concentration next to the aircraft surface, followed by a narrow region
of greatly increased droplet concentration farther out. Beyond the narrow
region of high concentration, the droplet concentration gradually decreases 
toward the free-stream value with increase in distance from the
surface of the aircraft.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shadow Zone<br>
The region of zero concentration adjacent to the surface of the ellipsoid, 
which is evident in figure 5, will be called the shadow zone.
This region is protected from droplet penetration by the air-flow characteristics
ahead of and in the vicinity of the forward positions of the
ellipsoid. The thickness (r - rs) of the shadow zone at each z position
of the body for various Reo and K values is given in figure 9. Generally, 
the thickness of the shadow zone increases as z approaches 0.
The shadow-zone thickness is 0 at the nose for all values of Reo and
K shown in figure 9 and becomes of finite thickness at a z position
that depends on Reo and K.</p>

<h3>Comparison of ellipsoid results</h3>
<p>From NACA-TN-3410:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the use of the same flight and atmospheric conditions, a comparison 
with the 20-percent-thick ellipsoid is possible, as shown in
figure 11. The abscissa is the distance from the ellipsoid surface, in
inches, at z = 0. For both the 10- and 20-percent-thick ellipsoids,
the major axis length is 20 feet, the flight speed is 300 miles per
hour, the altitude is 15,000 feet, and the volume-median droplet diameter 
is 20 microns. For both bodies the peak value of the concentration 
factor considerably decreases as the distribution broadens from
uniform droplets to a [Langmuir] "C" distribution (defined in ref. 1). Also, the
region that was a former shadow zone with zero concentration for the
cloud condition with uniform droplets becomes an area with a small concentration 
factor. A comparison of concentration-factor curves calculated for 
droplet-size distributions estimated to be present in clouds,
such as shown in figure 11, shows good qualitative agreement with the
shape of actual ice formations obtained on rod-shaped objects in flight
through the clouds (fig. 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 11. Effect of droplet-size distribution on concentration factor for ellipsoid, z=0. 
For uniform droplets, there is a shadow zone of zero concentration for 1 to 2 inch from the surface. 
Then there is a sharp concentration peak, that tapers off further from the surface." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-3410%2FFigure%2011.png"><br>
<em>From NACA-TN-3410.</em>  </p>
<p>However, note that K is based on ellipsoid length, not diameter, 
so for the same diameter at the same conditions the K values will differ by a factor of 2 
for the different ellipsoids. If the same body diameter were used, 
resulting in different body lengths, 
then a figure like Figure 11 would have more similar shadow zone thicknesses. </p>
<h3>Effect on multicylinder measurements</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, most liquid-water-content data taken with rotating of multicylinders are not too much in error 
from these factors, because the cylinders are, in practice, generally located far enough from the fuselage 
so that approximately free-stream conditions prevail. 
Therefore, the average concentration factor at the position of measurement gives a fair indication of the degree 
of error in measuring liquid-water content In typical installations (ref. 11), 
the lowest cylinder is about 16 inches from the aircraft surface and the top cylinder is about 34 inches 
from the surface. 
With the assumed 100-foot ellipsoid moving at 300 mph at 15,000 feet with an air temperature of 10 F 
and a "C" distribution with a 20-micron volume-median droplet diameter, 
the variation of concentration factor is given in figure 10(d). 
At 16 inches from the surface C = 1.095 (about 10 percent high), 
and at 34 incr C = 1.04 (about 4 percent high).
Thus the liquid-water-content measurements would be less than 10 percent too high. 
Actually, the values of liquid-water content summarized in references 14 and 15 may 
have a somewhat smaller error due to this effect than indicated by this example, 
because many of the measurements were obtained by using the local airspeed rather than 
the free-stream velocity for calculating the total catch of each cylinder. 
However, in spite of the relatively good location of rotating multicylinders, 
observers have reported occasional cases where the lower cylinder cause it excessively 
large or small amounts of ice. 
This was particularly true if the aircraft had a tendency to yaw during the measurements 
and thus alter the position of the shadow and peak-concentration zones. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>NACA-TN-3153:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
The data of this report are applicable in a quantitative manner only to ellipsoids of revolution with a fineness ratio of 5. 
They also apply approximately in the vicinity of the nose section of a body of revolution that can be physically matched with 
the nose section of a fineness-ratio 5 ellipsoid of a given length. 
Because many bodies of revolution of interest are different in shape from an ellipsoid, 
the data of this report are primarily useful in pointing out in a qualitative manner 
the type of variation in liquid-water concentration that might be expected in the vicinity of a body of revolution 
in flight through a droplet field. The analysis indicates that, for some combinations of the dimensionless parameters Reo and K, 
the value of the local concentration of liquid
water may vary from O to several times the free-stream value, 
depending on the location of the point being considered. 
Further, the calculations show that the magnitude of the concentration factor at any point is very sensitive to change in the parameters Re and K.</p>

<p>NACA-TN-3410: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS
The significance of the spatial variation of liquid-water content
and droplet size is discussed thoroughly in reference 1. The effect of
the spatial variation on measuring instruments and on the rotating
multicylinder method is also evaluated in reference 1. The importance
of avoiding measurements of liquid water and droplet size in the region
of variation of droplet concentration in the vicinity of an aircraft
fuselage is emphasized, because the correction of the indicated water
content and droplet-size distributions to free-stream conditions would
be very involved.<br>
The data of this report are applicable in a quantitative manner
only to ellipsoids of revolution with a fineness ratio of 10. As was
stated in reference 1 for a thicker body (fineness ratio of 5), these
data also apply approximately in the vicinity of the nose section of a
body of revolution that can be physically matched with the nose section
of a 10-percent-thick ellipsoid of a given length. The data are particularly 
applicable if the afterbody does not appreciably alter the
air-flow field ahead of the ellipsoid section from that attendant to an
ellipsoid. Because many bodies of revolution of interest are different
in shape from an ellipsoid, the data of this report and reference 1 are
primarily useful in pointing out in a qualitative manner the type of
variation in liquid-water concentration that might be expected In the
vicinity of a body of revolution In flight through a droplet field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-3153 and NACA-TN-3410 give a way of assessing water drop 
concentrations off of the airplane body.</p>
<p>However, despite the many detailed data charts (the publications are 69 and 52 pages each), 
one will often find that a condition of interest is not close to a case detailed in the publications. 
The relationships can be highly non-linear, and interpolation is challenging. 
In the current times, there are ample 2D and 3D water-drop trajectory tools to make an assessment. </p>
<p>Figures 10d and 11 above shows a rather smooth result when using a drop size distribution. 
I suspect that engineering judgement and/or artistic license was used to produce the curves. 
In practice, when using a seven bin Langmuir distributions, one is likely to see 
seven spikes, one for each drop size, albeit with attenuated peaks. 
Fine resolution is required to resolve the spikes. 
The spikes are an artifact of the discrete approximation analysis used. 
The ice shapes in Figure 1 show what a continuous, natural distribution produces. </p>
