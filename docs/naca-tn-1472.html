<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result of a fundamental investigation of the meteorological
conditions conducive to the formation of ice on aircraft and a study
of the process of airfoil thermal ice prevention, previously derived
equations for calculating the rate of heat transfer from airfoils in
icing conditions were verified. Knowledge of the manner in which
water is deposited on and evaporated from the surface of a heated
airfoil was expanded sufficiently to allow reasonably accurate calculations 
of airfoil heat requirements. The research consisted of
flight tests in natural-icing conditions with two 8-foot-chord, heated
airfoils of different sections. Measurements of the meteorological
variables conducive to ice formation were made simultaneously with the
procurement of airfoil thermal data.</p>
<p>It was concluded that the extent of knowledge on the meteorology
of icing, the impingement of water drops on airfoil surfaces, and the
processes of heat transfer and evaporation from a wetted airfoil
surface has been increased to a point where the design of heated wings
on a fundamental, wet-air basis now can be undertaken with reasonable
certainty.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is one of the longest reviews, as NACA-TN-1472 is long (108 pages) 
and is densely packed with information. 
Large portions of NACA-TN-1472 will be reproduced here.</p>
<p>The symbols are a little different from those previously in the 
<a href="/icing-thermodynamics.html">Thermodynamics thread</a>. </p>

<p>Large portions of NACA-TN-1472 will be reproduced herein.</p>
<p>A thermodynamic heat balance is outlined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ANALYSIS
During flight in icing conditions a heated wing is cooled by
convective heat transfer, by evaporation of the water on the surface,
and, in the region of droplet interception, by the water striking
the wing. The rate at which beat must be supplied in order to
maintain the wing surface at a specified temperature is, therefore, a
function of the rates of convection, evaporation, and water impingement.
Equations for expressing this heat requirement are presented in
references 5 and 6. These equations, with slight modification, are
used throughout this report.<br>
Expressed as an equation, the unit heat loss q from a partially
or completely wetted surface exposed to icing conditions may be stated:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Equation 1" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation1.png"> </p>
<h3>Heat transfer due to impinging water</h3>
<p>The heat transfer due to impinging water is detailed and then simplified (equation 4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heat Loss Due to Warming the Intercepted Water
In the region where water droplets strike the wing, the heat
required per unit area to heat the water to surface temperature is
<img alt="Equation 2" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation2.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Cpw is implicitly included (the value in the units used is 1 BTU/lbm-F, so it was omitted). 
In other unit systems, equation (2) should be:<br>
qw = Ma * Cpw * (ts - (to + Δtkw))</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term Δtkw is the kinetic temperature rise of the water caused
by stoppage of the droplets as they strike the wing. The value of
Δtkw is given by
<img alt="Equation 3" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation3.png"><br>
where V is the free-stream velocity in feet per second. The value
of Δtkw is less than 2 Fahrenheit for airplane speeds up to 200
miles an hour and, for the calculations presented in this report, the
term has been neglected. Equation (2) thus becomes:<br>
<img alt="Equation 4" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation4.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Runback" is defined: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weight rate of water impingement on the wing, the area of
and the distribution of the water over that area are
important factors in the heat-transfer analysis . In addition to the
effect of the amount of water intercepted on the value of qw in
equation (4), the evaluation of Ma provides an indication of the
quantity of water which must be maintained in a liquid state until
it either evaporates or runs off the trailing edge if the formation
of ice aft of the area of impingement, normally termed "<strong>runback</strong>," is
to be avoided. The area of impingement influences the extent of
heated region to be provided at the leading edge, while knowledge of
the distribution of water impingement is required in the calculation
of the heating requirement in areas where water is striking.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Rate of water impingement</h3>
<p>Water-drop impingement characteristics were obtained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preliminary calculations based on references 16 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and 17 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> indicated
that, for large values of drop size and airspeed, the assumption of
the equivalent cylinder would not hold for airfoils. Therefore, more
extensive calculations were undertaken to determine the drop trajectories 
for one of the test airfoils of this research, an NACA 0012
airfoil at 0 angle of attack. In these calculations, presented in
detail in reference 15 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, a Joukowski airfoil (the contour of which
closely approximates that of the NACA 0012) was used to supply the
stream lines since the Joukowski stream lines and velocity field can
be computed with relative ease. The basic equations presented in
reference 16 were used with modifications for deviation from Stokes'
law as given in reference 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rate of water impingement can now be evaluated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate of water impingement at a
specified point on an airfoil is a function of the area of impingement,
the velocity of flight, the liquid-water concentration of the air
stream, and the distribution of the intercepted vater over the surface.
This latter factor, called the concentration factor C is represented
by the ratio of Yo to s, or: 
<img alt="Equation 6" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation6.png"> </p>
<p>Using values of C obtained from figure 2, the weight of water impingement
at any point on the surface can be calculated from equation (7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Calculated water-drop impingement distribution over the surface of a 12 percent thick symmetrical Joukowski airfoil used to approximate the contour of a NACA 0012 section at 0 degree angle of attack. 
Free-stream Reynolds number of drop, Rd, 95.05" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Figure2.png"> </p>
<p><img alt="Equation 7" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation7.png"> </p>
<p>The effect of drop size distributions can be included: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of a cloud, where the water drops are not of uniform
size, but instead follow a pattern of size distribution, the rate of
impingement can be computed if the distribution is known or assumed.
The rate of water impingement at any point is the sum of all the rates
of impingement of the volume of water contained in each drop s1ze.
Equation (8) then becomes: 
<img alt="Equation 8" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation8.png"> 
where n is the concentration of liquid water contained in drops of
a particular size and C is the concentration factor for the K
value corresponding to that drop size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total water catch can be calculated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to establish the possibility of runback forming aft of
the heated area of a wing, it is necessary to know the total quantity
of water intercepted per unit of wing span. This rate of impingement,
denoted as Me in pounds per hour, foot span, is given by 
<img alt="Equation 9" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation9.png"> 
A more rapid method for the evaluation of Me utilizes a curve of
collection efficiency E as a function of K (fig. 3). Collection
efficiency is defined as: 
<img alt="Equation 10" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation10.png"> 
where Yolimit is the value of Yo for which drops of a particular
K value just miss the airfoil, and Ymax is the maximum ordinate of
the airfoil. The equation for computing Me, then, is

</blockquote>
<h3>Heat Loss Due to Forced Convection</h3>
<p>The unit heat flow from the surface of a body in an air stream
resulting from convective heat transfer can be expressed:
<img alt="Equation 12" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation12.png"> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>where ts is the surface temperature and tok is the kinetic temperature 
of the free-stream air at the point for which the heat flow is
being computed. The factor h is the convective heat-transfer
coefficient and may be evaluated by measurements in clear air or by
calculation using the methods presented in references 18 and 19.
Evaluation of the term tok will now be discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...
<img alt="Equation 13 and 14" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation13_14.png"> </p>
<p>Here we see the water drop equilibrium assumption, re-stated as 
"evaporation of water from the surface". 
Note that this portion of evaporation is evaluated at the kinetic temperature, 
not at the heated surface temperature. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In clouds, the kinetic temperature rise is reduced, due to
evaporation of water from the surface. Assuming the surface is
completely wetted with water, the value of the temperature rise for
laminar flow becomes
<img alt="Equation 15 and 16" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation15_16.png"> 
<img alt="Equation 17" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation17.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An alternative way of calculating "tok" was selected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experiments in clouds, in the process of calibrating a free-air
thermometer installation (reference 13), showed that by multiplying
the clear-air kinetic-temperature rise by the ratio of the saturated
to the dry adiabatic lapse rates, good agreement between the values
of kinetic temperature rise calculated in this manner and the measured
values was obtained. Since use of the ratio of the adiabatic lapse
rates was substantiated experimentally, and since equation (17) must
be solved by trial, a somewhat laborious procedure, the following
equations were used in this report to calculate values of tok: 
<img alt="Equation 18 and 19" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equations18_19.png"> 
Values of αs/αd, the ratio of the wet- to the dry-adiabatic lapse
rates, are obtained from figure 4. The use of the lapse-rate ratio
in equations (18) and (19) is semi-empirical. The limitations of
this simplification in the calculation of kinetic-temperature rise of
airfoil surfaces in clouds are not known. Below speeds of 200 miles
per hour, however, these equations can be used with small error, since
the kinetic-temperature rise is low. 
<img alt="Figure 4. Ratio of saturated- to dry-adiabatic lapse rates as a function of temperature and pressure altitude." src="images/naca-tn-1472/Figure4.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Heat Loss Due to Evaporation of the Water on the Surface</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of heat removed from a wetted surface as a result of
the evaporation of water on that surface can be expressed: 
<img alt="Equation 20" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation20.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lumped and linearized value X for convection and evaporation is developed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From reference 6 the relation between Qe and the convective
heat-transfer coefficient h can be expressed for a completely
wetted surface as: 
<img alt="Equations 21 22 23" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equations21_23.png"> 
The values chosen for Ls and cp are 11OO Btu per pound and 0.24
Btu per pound, Fahrenheit, respectively. The factor PSL/P1 is the
ratio of the standard sea-level pressure to the local static pressure.<br>
It should be noted that the evaporation factor X applies only
when the surface is completely wetted. If only partial wetness
prevails, the value of X must be modified according to the degree
of wetness</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Total heat loss from a wetted surface</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarizing the heat losses due to water impingement, convection,
and evaporation, equation (1) can be written: 
<img alt="Equation 24" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation24.png"> </p>
<p>Aft of the region of water impingement, Ma = 0 and equation (24)
becomes 
<img alt="Equation 25" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Equation25.png"> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Flight tests</h3>
<p>Detailed test articles were constructed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two electrically heated test airfoils were used to obtain
fundamental data on the process of wing thermal ice prevention. Each
airfoil was mounted vertically on top of the fuselage of the C-46
airplane, as shown in figure 5. The test airfoil installed during
the winter of 1945-46 had an NACA 0012 section.</p>
<p>Measurements of the temperature of the aluminum surface of the
test section were obtained by means of thermocouples.<br>
...<br>
Thermocouples were located at the center of
the test section at 1-inch chordwise intervals in the leading-edge
and calculated transition regions, and at 1-1/2-inch chordwise
intervals in other regions. Surface temperatures were recorded by
means of self-balancing automatic-recording potentiometers.</p>
<p>The flow of heat through the outer surface was calculated from
measurements of the power dissipated in the electrical heating
strips. This power was determined by measuring the resistance of
the strips and the current flowing through them. Thermocouples
placed on both surfaces of the plastic base at a number of chordwise
stations gave an indication of the heat flow into the model interior.
These thermocouples were connected to the same recording potentiometers 
used to record surface temperatures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TEST PROCEDURE<br>
The test airplane was flown into natural-icing conditions over
most of the northwestern area of the United States during the winter
of 1945-46. During the winter of 1946-47 the area of operations was
extended to include a few flights in the central and eastern part of
the United States. The usual test procedure, during flight in icing
conditions, was to record. airfoil data simultaneously with the
measurement of the meteorological conditions. The rotating cylinders,
described in reference 13, which constituted the means of measuring
liquid-water concentration, drop size, and drop-size distribution,
were extended as often as was conveniently possible. Records of
free-air temperature, airspeed, and altitude were taken several times
a minute. The recording potentiometer used to obtain airfoil temperatures 
was operated continuously. During this time, the values of
current flow through the electrical heating strips of the airfoil
were recorded. Photographs of the test-section surface and records
of pressure distribution were taken at frequent intervals. </p>

<p><img alt="Table I" src="images/naca-tn-1472/Table1.png"> </p>
<h3>Runback water</h3>
<p>The water that runs back on a surface is not usually a uniform sheet of water. 
The water tends to breakup into rivulets. 
This was characterized: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A picture of the conditions of wetness which existed on the
airfoil during flight in clouds can be seen in figure 15. This
figure shows some typical records obtained with strips of blueprint
paper which had been fastened to a device that could be extended
into the air stream up the leading edge of the airfoil model to a
point just below the test section. Since, in effect, these were
wrapped around the leading edge of the model, they illustrate the
pattern that the water assumes in striking the airfoil and flowing
aft. The records were obtained during icing conditions 11, 13, and
14, table II.

</blockquote>
<p>This was (roughly) correlated with water runback rate 
(although a constant value of about 0.25 would fit the data as well, IMHO).</p>

<h3>Analysis results</h3>
<p>For brevity, we will examine the NACA 0012 test article results (only). </p>
<p>With measured flight test values for t_surface and heat applied to the heating strips, 
equations 24 and 25 were used to infer an external heat transfer coefficient, 
shown in Figure 8 ("H"). </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 8a. Thermal data obtained with the NACA 0012 electrically heated airfoil model." src="images/naca-tn-1472/Figure8a.png"> </p>
<p>A python implementation (file "naca_tn_1472.py" <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>) found similar values. </p>
<p><img alt="Python analysis of figure 8a conditions" src="images/naca-tn-1472/naca_tn_1472_fig8a.png"></p>
<p>The analysis can be used to determine surface temperatures from the heating and heat transfer coefficients 
(rather than determining heat transfer coefficients for the surface temperatures and heating, as above). 
A set of heat transfer coefficients was used:

<h3>Heat transfer coefficients</h3>
<p>For the same airfoil flying at similar conditions, 
we saw several measurements and estimates of the 
external heat transfer coefficients.</p>
<p><img alt="external heat transfer coefficients" src="images/naca-tn-1472/naca_tn_1472_hc_comparison.png"> </p>
<p>The values calculated in icing conditions ware uniformly higher than those in dry air conditions.
NACA-TN-1472 offers an explanation of surface roughness about the transition region:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very likely that disturbance of the boundary layer, caused
by <strong>water drops striking the airfoil surface and roughening the surface</strong>
as they coalesce and flow aft, would effect a forward movement of
transition. There is further evidence to support the assumption that
the water-roughened surface caused movement of transition forward.
Observations of the 65,2-016 airfoil during a flight in clear air
with toe test section heated indicated that transition had shifted
forward by a considerable amount. This was noted by a lowering of
the surface temperature in the region aft of the leading edge. The
heat distribution had been set previously to produce a constant
surface temperature in clear air, and only a change in the boundary-layer 
characteristics could cause the evident change in heat-transfer
coefficient. After the flight, a close examination of the leading-edge 
region of the airfoil revealed small insects stuck to the
surface where they had hit during the flight. The surface was wiped
clean and during a subsequent flight in clear air it was noted that
transition had moved back again, as evidenced by the restoration of
the surface temperatures to normal. Thus, <strong>it appears that very small
irregularities in the surface, such as are present on the surface of
an airfoil in icing conditions, are sufficient to cause transition to
occur prematurely</strong>. Tests in wind tunnels also have shown that small
protuberances in the leading-edge region of an airfoil will cause
the movement of transition forward. (See reference 24.)  </p>
<p>The exact values of the convective heat-transfer coefficient in
the region aft of the area of impingement in icing conditions are
unknown, but it 1s believed the values fluctuate due to changes in
the location of transition during flight. Very probably, the
disturbance to the boundary layer caused by water on the airfoil
surface is of such a character as to create instability in the
boundary layer, and cause the location of transition to fluctuate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not find this explanation of differences in the aft region to be very convincing,
as the differences extend more than "a short distance": </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the curves of heat-transfer coefficient measured during
flight in icing conditions, shown in figures 8(a) to 8(f) and 12(a)
to 12(g), display a definite increase in the aft region of high heat
intensity, suggesting that transition is located at this point. It
should be noted that the increase in heat-transfer coefficient
indicated by these curves is believed to be only an apparent increase,
caused by the rapid change in heating intensity in this region. If
the coefficient is relatively constant throughout this area, as it is
believed to be, a sudden increase in heating intensity will not be
accompanied by an equally rapid change in the thermal boundary layer,
and <strong>for a short distance aft the indicated values of heat-transfer
coefficient will be erroneously high</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the statement below that "In this [aft] region, the
measured heat-flow curve and the calculated curve of convective heat
transfer come together", the values do not correspond well: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aft region of high heat flow (figs. 23 and 24), the
values of convective heat-transfer coefficient are known, since
turbulent flow existed in this region in clear air, when the values
were measured, as well as in icing conditions. <strong>In this region, the
measured heat-flow curve and the calculated curve of convective heat
transfer come together</strong>, indicating that at the point where the curves ·
coincide all the water on the surface has been evaporated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference near S/C=0 are not explained. </p>
<p>Determining the heat transfer coefficients was a challenge in the NACA era, 
and is still a challenge in the current era. 
A heat transfer textbook <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> advises: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foregoing correlations are suitable for most engineering calculations. 
However, they should not be viewed as providing exact determinations of the 
coefficients. Conditions may vary according to the freestream turbulence and 
surface roughness, and <strong>it would be unreasonable to expect the correlations to 
predict results to better than 25% accuracy</strong>. This statement made be made 
for virtually all the correlations to be considered.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would extend the statement above to include modern, 3D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) tools, 
which can report computed results to great precision, but often unknown accuracy for heat transfer coefficients. 
Some CFD tools do not include surface roughness, and so would be limited for the surface water induced roughness cases noted above. </p>
<p>The heat transfer coefficients affect the heating required to evaporate all water, 
and so the use of coefficients that include the turbulent transition are recommended for system design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total heat flow required [in Figure 27]
to evaporate all the water within the area from 0 to 14 percent s/c
with transition at 5 percent s/c is <strong>approximately 10 percent greater
than the amount of heat required if laminar flow prevails</strong>. Apparently,
the location of transition moves forward in conditions of icing, even
in the presence of a favorable pressure gradient, to a point where a
strong favorable pressure gradient is encountered (figs. 11 and 16).
As was stated previously, the location of transition is believed to
fluctuate, probably over a considerable distance. <strong>It is suggested
that forward movement of transition to a point close to the leading
edge of the wing be assumed in the design of thermal ice-prevention
equipment, especially in view of the fact that a greater amount of
heat is required for the turbulent-flow condition</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing discussion, it is concluded that the extent
of knowledge on the meteorology of icing, the impingement of water
drops on airfoil surfaces, and the processes of heat transfer and
evaporation from a wetted airfoil surface has been increased to a
point where the design of heated wings on a fundamental, wet-air
basis now can be undertaken with reasonable certainty. In addition
to this general conclusion, the following conclusions are drawn,
based on test data and analytical studies of the processes of heat
transfer and evaporation from a heated wing.
1. The heat should be concentrated as much as possible in the
leading-edge region of the wing in the area of water-drop impingement, 
if an efficient thermal system is to be obtained.
2. An increase in altitude, for the same rate and area of water
impingement on a wing and for the same conditions of true airspeed
and free-air temperature, decreases the heat requirement for thermal
ice prevention.
3. A wing thermal ice-prevention system which has been designed
to evaporate all impinging water in the leading-edge region for a
relatively high free-air temperature (20F) will be capable of ice
prevention at low air temperatures (0F) in icing conditions nearly
as severe as those upon which the design was based.</p>
