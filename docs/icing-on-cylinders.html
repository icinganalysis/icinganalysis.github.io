<h2>Summary</h2>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cylinder has a wide range of current uses in aviation:<br>
- Meteorological instruments for flight and icing wind tunnel tests<br>
- Aircraft in-flight ice detectors and indicators<br>
- Structural elements (such as landing gear and cables)<br>
- An approximation of an airfoil leading edge (used in thermal design and icing wind tunnel test conditions determination <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>)   </p>
<p>Icing conditions measurements with instruments based on cylinders were key to developing the 
current aircraft flight in icing certification regulations.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-two NACA publications related to aircraft icing were 
identified in <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">"The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications"</a>, 
and categorized into 16 topics.</p>
<p>Publications related to icing on a cylinder will include several of the 16 topics, 
such as “Meteorology of Icing Clouds”, “Meteorological Instruments” 
and “Impingement of Cloud Droplets” (as cylinders were and still are used as icing measurement instruments), 
as well as “Heat Transfer”. With a firm foundation in those concepts, 
one may then move on to other topics, including ice protection.</p>
<p>The cylinder is geometrically simple, but is aerodynamically complex with flow separation for many conditions, 
and so it will present worthy challenges. </p>
<h2>The Cylinder Thread</h2>
<p>These reviews will focus on water drop impingement and icing on cylinders. 
However, as cylinders were important instruments for meteorological measurements, some measurement results will be included. 
The accuracy of the cylinder when used as an instrument for determining icing conditions will be re-evaluated several times 
in the publications. 
While such instruments had limitations, they were often the best available technology at the time. 
(Also see the <a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">Meteorological Instruments Thread</a>). </p>
<p>Some typical multicylinder meteorological instruments (from NACA-TN-2708):<br>
