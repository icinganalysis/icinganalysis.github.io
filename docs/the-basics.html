<em>from "Effects of Ice Formations on Airplane Performance in Level Cruising Flight." NACA-TN-1598, 1948. <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19810068605">ntrs.nasa.gov</a></em>  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Basics provide "the least that you need to know" to begin the study of Aircraft Icing.  </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Basics acquaint you with the specialized terminology and concepts of aircraft in-flight icing. 
This is intended for engineers, scientists, and administrators newly interested in aircraft icing, 
or for those familiar with some but not all aspects of aircraft icing. </p>
<p>The Basics assume little knowledge of aircraft, and do not require math skills 
(there are only a few numbers that give ranges of typical values). 
The Basics are short and minimal, "the least that you need to know". 
Once you are oriented with the concepts and terms, you will be better able to 
ask questions and shape online searches for what you would like to know more about. </p>
<p>The <a href="/resources.html">Resources section</a> has many options for further study.  </p>
<h2>Some limitations</h2>
<p>The Basics are a work in progress, as there may yet be many revisions and additions. 
However, it may be useful "as is" to some readers.  </p>
<p>These basics concepts by themselves will not make you a qualified aircraft design engineer, 
a pilot with a rating for flight in icing, 
or a weather scientist. </p>
<p>In-flight icing (only) is covered. </p>
<p>Topics that are specifically not included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Icing on the ground</li>
<li>Piloting in icing weather  </li>
<li>Certification  </li>
</ul>
<p>While the information here may be complementary, 
for the topics above there is ample formal training available. 
I believe that there are no conflicts here with that formal training. 
If there are conflicts, follow your formal training, 
and please let me know so that I can correct things. </p>
<p>However, there are documents on those topics that contain 
more general information, and excerpts from those will be used here.  </p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>The Basics series is offered under the Creative Commons 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> 
license. See the link for what this allows you to do with it. </p>
<p>All images used in this The Basics series are public domain, and the source is noted below the image.  </p>
<h2>Curation</h2>
<p>An effort has been made to use current sources. 
This differs from the companion 
<a href="/">"Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications"</a> reviews of historical publications. 
The Basics series is largely independent of the rest of the "Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications" blog, 
except for the Resources. 
I will, however, generally use the oldest image that illustrates a concept, often from the NACA era.  </p>
<p>Links to sources were checked at the "Updated:" date at the top of the page. 
Like any online resource, there may be "link rot" after that date, 
and then you will have to try your 
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">favorite search engine</a> to find where it moved to.  </p>
<p>You might find other resources with online searches, but I have only included links that I am familiar with. </p>
<h2>Studying The Basics</h2>
<p>It is suggested that you read the concepts in the order below. </p>
<p>Note that when a term introduced it is capitalized in quotes, such as <a href="/terminology.html#glaze-ice">"Glaze Ice"</a>. 
Terms are defined in context in the sections below, 
and there is a <a href="/terminology.html">Terminology</a> section available.  </p>
<p>Each concept has a resources section, with specific further reading on the concept. </p>
