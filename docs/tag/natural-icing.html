<h1>NACA-TN-1904, "Observations of Icing Conditions Encountered in Flight During 1948" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h1>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The average liquid water content varies over distance traveled in icing.</li>
<li>The value of the multicylinder method for determining drop size distributions is questioned.  </li>
<li>Other flight test instruments are described.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Meteorological data from flight observations in icing conditions
during the first 5 months of 1948 are presented. A total of 335
measurements of liquid-water content and mean-effective drop diameter
were obtained by the multicylinder method in the course of 40 flights
in icing conditions covering most of northern United States. Cumulus
clouds were predominant during approximately two-thirds of the flights.
A continuous record of liquid-water content covering a major portion
of the operations was obtained by means of a rotating-disk icing-rate
meter. This record was used to investigate the relation between average 
liquid-water content and the horizontal extent of icing conditions.
An analysis of values of maximum drop diameter calculated from the
area of drop impingement on a stationary cylinder and corresponding
values of mean-effective drop diameter and dropsize distribution as
obtained from the rotating cylinders led to the conclusion that the
rotating-cylinder indications of drop-size distribution are so unreliable 
that they are of little or no value. The data indicate that
average and maximum values of drop size are significantly greater
and more variable near the Pacific coast than in the other parts of
the United States included in this investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Variation in liquid water content with distance</h3>
<p>Data was gathered in icing clouds in flight, with flight paths that were often not straight lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be emphasized that, due to the small number of cases 
included in the analysis, the results are not quantitatively accurate. 
They do, however, give a general idea of the relation between extent 
and average liquid-water content in icing conditions. Another important 
factor which affects the validity of these results is the effect 
of the circling flight paths which were followed in an effort to remain 
in cumulus clouds. The actual horizontal extent of most of the cumulus 
clouds investigated was from 1 to 3 miles. The high values of water 
content recorded for longer distances were due to the practice of 
circling within clouds or making repeated passes through a single cloud. 
For this reason, the frequency data foi 10 seconds duration (1/2 mile)
in cumulus clouds are regarded as representative, the values for 1 minute 
(3 miles) are subject to some error, but are regarded as approximately
 representative, while the results for 5 minutes (15 miles) or more are
 believed to be considerably higher than would be encountered in straight
 flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data were summarized in a table.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An analysis of continuous records of liquid-water content 
obtained with the rotating-disk icing-rate meter, adjusted by comparison 
with rotating-cylinder data from previous seasons, yields 
the following values of maximum liquid-water content averaged over 
various distances. These values are likely to be encountered once 
in the course of 1000 flights in icing conditions when it is assumed 
that 5 percent of the flights encounter cumulus clouds.</li>
</ol>

<p>This was based on a comparison of maximum drop size a determined by a stationary cylinder to the mean-effective drop diameter and best fit distribution determined by the multicylinder method.

<p>However, as we saw in <a href="/naca-rm-a9c09.html">NACA-RM-A9C09</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, 
the error in estimating maximum drop size from maximum impingement limit on a fixed cylinder 
is as large as the error determining the MVD from the multicylinder method, 
so the maximum drop size determined may not be so reliable of a value to compare with.  </p>
<p>In the later NACA-TR-1215 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (of which William Lewis was also an author of) a more nuanced view of the drop size distribution 
determination will be found.</p>
<p>Also note that the determination of the mean-effective drop diameter (MED) is not disputed, only the distribution determination is disputed.  </p>
<h3>Multicylinder accuracy</h3>

<h3>Appendix A</h3>
<p>There is an extensive Appendix A that describes the flight test instruments used. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE CLOUD INDICATOR (heated cylinder)  </p>
<p>It had become apparent during previous years that an instrumental 
method of supplementing visual observations of the time of entering 
and leaving clouds, q d the patchy or uniform characteristics of 
the cloud masses was desirable, The cloud indicator was designed to 
meet this need. This instrument consists of a heated cylinder 5/8 
inch in diameter exposed at right angles to the air stream, with a 
thermocouple installed to measure the surface temperature at the 
stagnation point. To provide a continuous surface-temperature 
record, the thermocouple is connected to a self-balancing potentiometer 
equipped to provide a continuous ink trace of the variations
in temperature. In use, the heating power supplied to the cylinder
is adjusted to maintain a surface temperature of from 170 F to
200 F when flying in clear air. Immediately upon entering a cloud,
the temperature drops very rapidly, sometimes by as much as 5 F
in 1 second. Similarly, a rapid rise of temperature is observed
on leaving a cloud. Small areas of clear air within a cloud and
variations of cloud density are indicated by irregularities in the
temperature trace. Figure 6 is an example of the response of this
instrument during passage through various types of clouds. As indicated 
in the figure, the instrument is more sensitive to liquid-water drops
than to snow. Thus, it is possible to identify regions
containing liquid water in a continuous snow cloud.  </p>

various cloud types." src="images%2Fnaca-tn-1904%2FFigure%206.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MAXIMUM-DROPSIZE CYLINDER  </p>
<p>This device, which is described in reference 2, permits the
determination of the angular extent of ice collected on a stationary
cylinder 5 inches in diameter. With this information, the diameter
of the largest drops present in significant quantity can be calculated.
The angle is measured by visual observation of the edge of the ice
formation against a scale consisting of white marks spaced at 10'
intervals on the surface of the cylinder. When the values of maximum 
drop diameter from the stationary cylinder observations were
compared with corresponding values of mean-effective diameter, as
measured by the rotating cylinders, it was noted that in more than
half the cases the indicated maximum diameter was less than the mean-effective 
diameter. ...</p>
<p>THE ROTATING-DISK ICING-RATE METER  </p>
<p>The rotating-disk icing-rate meter used by the Ames Aeronautical 
Laboratory is a modification of the instrument developed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (See references 8 and 9.)
The rotating disk, measuring arm, and scraper are essentially the
same as in the M.I.T. instrument. However, the magnetic method of
measuring the thickness of ice on the edge of the disk has been
replaced by a mechanical and optical system. In the Ames instrument, 
the movement of the measuring arm actuates a mirror which
causes the image of a lamp filament to move along a slit. A moving
photographic film which passes beneath the slit provides a continuous 
record of the position of the measuring arm.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The following conclusions are drawn from an analysis of flight

<li>An analysis of continuous records of liquid-water content 
obtained with the rotating-disk icing-rate meter, adjusted by comparison 
with rotating-cylinder data from previous seasons, yields 
the following values of maximum liquid-water

various distances. These values are likely to be encountered once 
in the course of 1000 flights in icing conditions when it is assumed 
that 5 percent of the flights encounter cumulus clouds.  </li>
