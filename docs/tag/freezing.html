<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A photographic technique for investigating water droplets of diameter 
less than 200 microns falling freely in air at temperatures between
0° C and -50° C has been devised and used to determine:<br>
(1) The shape of frozen droplets<br>
(2) The occurrence of collisions of partly frozen or of frozen and
liquid droplets<br>
(3) The statistics on the freezing temperatures of individual
free-falling droplets  </p>
<p>A considerable number of droplets were found to have a non-spherical
shape after freezing because of various protuberances and frost growth,
and droplet aggregates formed by collision. The observed frequency of
collision of partly frozen droplets showed good order of magnitude agreement 
with the …</p></blockquote>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A Bragg X-ray spectrometer equipped with a volume-sensitive Geiger 
counter and Soller slits and employing filtered molybdenum Kα, radiation 
was used to obtain a set of diffracted intensity curves as a function 
of angle for supercooled water. Diffracted intensity curves in 
the temperature region of 21° to -16° C were obtained. The minimum
between the two main diffraction peaks deepened continuously with 
lowering temperature, indicating a gradual change in the internal 
structure of the water. No discontinuity in this trend was noted at 
the melting point. The internal structure of supercooled water was
concluded to become progressively more ice-like as the temperature 
is lowered.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There was limited data for properties of liquid water below the temperature of 0° C (supercooled water) at the start of the NACA-era. 
The five studies reviewed here sought to improve the data available.  </p>
<p>The authors were well-informed of other studies available at the time. 
New instruments were conceived and built for these studies. </p>
<p>These five studies largely considered water drops, 
although much of the data are also applicable to more general aircraft icing analysis.  </p>
<p>Four of the studies concern the temperature at which supercooled water drops will 
spontaneously freeze (freeze without outside influence other than temperature).  </p>
<p>Several of the studies note similarities of the properties …</p>
