<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper summarizes some of the techniques used in N.A.C.A. research programs, 
in flight and in tunnels, to solve aircraft icing problems and it indicates 
the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing protection systems. 
Sufficient data have been obtained, generalized where possible, and techniques have 
been established whereby icing-protection requirements for most aircraft components 
can be determined sufficiently accurately for engineering purposes. 
The Appendices discuss the icing facilities at the N.A.C.A. Lewis laboratory in detail, 
specific test equipment and techniques used in conducting tests in icing wind tunnels, 
and several icing instruments.  </p>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Heating requirements for satisfactory cyclic de-icing over a wide
range of icing and operating conditions have been determined for a gas-heated, 
36° swept airfoil of 6.9-foot chord with a partial-span leading-edge slat. 
Comparisons of heating requirements and effectiveness were
made between the slatted and unslatted portions of the airfoil. Studies
were also made comparing cyclic de-icing with continuous anti-icing, and
cyclic de-icing systems with and without leading-edge ice-free parting
strips. De-icing heat requirements were approximately the same with either 
heated or unheated parting strips because of the aerodynamic effects
of the 36° sweep angle and the spanwise saw-tooth profile of leading-edge
glaze-ice deposits. Cyclic de-icing heat-source requirements were found
to be one-fourth or less of the heat requirements for …</p></blockquote>

<p>A tip section of a delta wing having an NACA 0004-65 airfoil section

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Several methods of cyclic de-icing of a gas-heated airfoil were
investigated to determine ice-removal characteristics and heating requirements. 
The cyclic de-icing system with a spanwise ice-free parting strip
in the stagnation region and a constant-temperature gas-supply duct gave
the quickest and most reliable ice removal. Heating requirements for the
several methods of cyclic de-icing are compared, and the savings over
continuous ice prevention are shown. Data are presented to show the
relation of surface temperature, rate of surface heating, and heating
time to the removal of ice.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The convective heat transfer from the surface of an ellipsoidal fore-body

clear air for both stationary and rotating operation over a range of 
conditions including air speeds up to 240 knots, rotational speeds up to
1200 rpm, and angles of attack of 0°, 3°, and 6°. The results are presented 
in the form of heat-transfer coefficients and the correlation of

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Investigations have been made in flight and in wind tunnels tc
determine which components of turbojet installations are most critical
in icing conditions, and to evaluate several methods of icing protection. 
From these studies, the requirements necessary for adequate
icing protection and the consequent penalties on engine performance
can be estimated.  </p>
<p>Because investigations have indicated that the compressor-inlet
screen constitutes the greatest icing hazard and is difficult to protect, 
complete removal or retraction of the screen upon encountering
an icing condition is recommended. In the absence of the screen, the
inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine constitute the
greatest danger to engine operation in an icing condition; a centrifugal-
type engine, on the other hand, is relatively unsusceptible to icing

<p>An investigation was conducted to determine the electric power

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The three areas of the many and varied contributions of Porter Perkins are reviewed.  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>I will focus on three areas of Porter Perkins' publications:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Foresight about supercooled large drop (SLD) icing  </li>
<li>A shift in instrument calibration</li>
<li>Contributions to the Appendix C icing regulation   </li>
</ul>
<h2>Foresight about supercooled large drop (SLD) icing</h2>
<p>I am not sure that I agree with the quote at the top (from 1993) now. 
A lot of things have happened in three decades. </p>
<p>Perkins and Rieke <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> foreshadowed in 1993 the potential effects of large-size water-drop icing conditions,

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The thermal analysis of icing conditions has unique challenges, 
including the determination of heat transfer coefficients and fraction of the surface wetted.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Measured heat transfer coefficients in dry air can be different between flight and tunnel tests, due to free stream turbulence. </li>
<li>Icing conditions tend to promote more turbulent flow on the surface.  </li>
<li>Assumptions about the fraction of the surface wetted aft of impingement affect the thermal analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Combustion heated air, independent of the engines, was used on some aircraft.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA.  </li>
<li>38 NACA publications detail technical aspects of aircraft heaters, 
including many details on heat exchangers, maturing engineering designs.  </li>
<li>Three publications deal with heat transfer for ice protection.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There were numerous NACA publications on aircraft heaters. 
For the combustion heaters, air was scooped in, 
heated by burning aviation gasoline, 
and used for cabin heating, and wing ice protection on some airplanes
(The DC-6, for example). </p>
<p>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA 
prior to these NACA publications. 
However, the NACA publications very much detailed

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>A chordwise-sequenced zone heating ice shedding strategy was devised.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
Also, there are scale differences, as a wing airfoil

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating becomes common for ice protection in the jet era.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>To support jet engine powered transportation, NACA had several studies of ice protection using compressed air heating.  </li>
<li>Deicing schemes were proposed to reduce the amount of air bled from the engines.  </li>
<li>Some innovative features, like continuously heated parting strips and 
recirculating hot air supply, did not see much use.  </li>
<li>Compressed air heating is used widely today for jet powered transports.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As aviation entered the jet propulsion age, 
reciprocating-engine exhaust heat was not an option. 
However, the jet engine air compressor offers an ample 
(but not unlimited) supply of hot, compressed air that may be bled 
from the engine compressor airstream 
for ice protection, cabin heating, and other functions. </p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Carburetor icing has been a known hazard for over 100 years.  </li>
<li>Part of the hazard can occur in clear air (throttling icing and fuel-evaporation icing).  </li>
<li>"The NACA induction-system icing program at the National Bureau of Standards was initiated in January 1941. The project is financed jointly by the Army, the Navy, and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics."  </li>
<li>Numerous tests and studies were conducted in the NACA-era.  </li>
<li>Many aircraft today have carburetor protection similar to that developed in the NACA-era.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The spark ignition, Otto cycle engines 
commonly used on airplanes in the NACA-era 
typically had carburetors to control the air and fuel entering the cylinders for combustion. 
These could be affect by ice …</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a>, 
the “expanding rubber sheet” or “ice-removing overshoe”
for ice protection was developed independently of NACA in the 1930s, 
and was the first widely used method of aircraft ice protection. 
Small passages within the rubber could be periodically inflated to shed ice (typically once every two minutes). 
While some "inter-cycle" ice forms, the maximum amount …</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Numerous methods were tested to find effective aircraft ice protection in the NACA-era.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>During the war, more than a hundred cargo planes of the Air Transport Command, 
flying from bases in India over the Hump to battlefronts in China, crashed
in the Himalayas. Most of them were brought down by ice. In a single day in 1944,
nine of these big Army transports, loaded with sorely needed supplies for the Allies’
fighting forces, were lost.<br>
Many of the fatal crashes of commercial aviation have been traced to this same
cause. For years commercial transports have been equipped with anti-icing devices,
but the apparatus in common use was designed to assist in meeting an emergency
when it arises, not to prepare the plane for deliberate flight into ice clouds. 
If dangerous icing conditions are inadvertently encountered …</p></blockquote>
