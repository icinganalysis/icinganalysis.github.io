<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Ice protection system development continues to address new challenges.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Design guides can lead you to "adequate" designs for several technologies.  </li>
<li>Design guides provide procedures to compare candidate systems.  </li>
<li>Optimal designs and new requirements may require system development.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We have seen "the possible methods for overcoming the ice hazard" 
that were developed in the NACA-era in this <a href="/ice-protection.html">Ice Protection Thread</a>. 
The period up to and through WWII (1945) was largely characterized by expeditious tests to 
address immediate icing problems. </p>
<p>The quote above "The industry has now passed through the experimental stages of heating and anti-icing ..."
from 1946 was not completely the case, but NACA did move on to 
more planned scientific and engineering tests and analysis methods development.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The knowledge of aircraft icing matured to produce engineering design manuals.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>NACA publications contributed heavily to later design manuals.  </li>
<li>Extensive design publications distilling research into practical methods appeared in the 1950s.  </li>
<li>I do not know of a comprehensive design resource for some recent topics such as 3D design and analysis.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>NACA had an early period (up to and including WWII) 
that was largely characterized by expeditious tests to 
address immediate icing problems. 
Later, NACA embarked on more scientifically oriented studies. 
The science and experience of aircraft ice protection had matured enough 
by the 1950s for comprehensive engineering design manuals to be written.  </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The thermal analysis of icing conditions has unique challenges, 
including the determination of heat transfer coefficients and fraction of the surface wetted.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Measured heat transfer coefficients in dry air can be different between flight and tunnel tests, due to free stream turbulence. </li>
<li>Icing conditions tend to promote more turbulent flow on the surface.  </li>
<li>Assumptions about the fraction of the surface wetted aft of impingement affect the thermal analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Combustion heated air, independent of the engines, was used on some aircraft.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA.  </li>
<li>38 NACA publications detail technical aspects of aircraft heaters,

<li>Three publications deal with heat transfer for ice protection.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There were numerous NACA publications on aircraft heaters. 
For the combustion heaters, air was scooped in, 
heated by burning aviation gasoline, 
and used for cabin heating, and wing ice protection on some airplanes
(The DC-6, for example). </p>
<p>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA 
prior to these NACA publications. 
However, the NACA publications very much detailed

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>A chordwise-sequenced zone heating ice shedding strategy was devised.  </li>
<li>The current 787 jet aircraft uses electrothermal heating for wing anti-icing and de-icing.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
Also, there are scale differences, as a wing airfoil 
usually has a larger chord length than a propeller.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating becomes common for ice protection in the jet era.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>To support jet engine powered transportation, NACA had several studies of ice protection using compressed air heating.  </li>
<li>Deicing schemes were proposed to reduce the amount of air bled from the engines.  </li>
<li>Some innovative features, like continuously heated parting strips and 
recirculating hot air supply, did not see much use.  </li>
<li>Compressed air heating is used widely today for jet powered transports.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As aviation entered the jet propulsion age, 
reciprocating-engine exhaust heat was not an option. 
However, the jet engine air compressor offers an ample 
(but not unlimited) supply of hot, compressed air that may be bled 
from the engine compressor airstream 
for ice protection, cabin heating, and other functions. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Numerous methods were tested to find effective aircraft ice protection in the NACA-era.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>During the war, more than a hundred cargo planes of the Air Transport Command, 
flying from bases in India over the Hump to battlefronts in China, crashed
in the Himalayas. Most of them were brought down by ice. In a single day in 1944,
nine of these big Army transports, loaded with sorely needed supplies for the Allies’
fighting forces, were lost.<br>
Many of the fatal crashes of commercial aviation have been traced to this same
cause. For years commercial transports have been equipped with anti-icing devices,
but the apparatus in common use was designed to assist in meeting an emergency
when it arises, not to prepare the plane for deliberate flight into ice clouds. 
If dangerous icing conditions are inadvertently encountered …</p></blockquote>
