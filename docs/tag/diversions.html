<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The state of the art in 1969 of aircraft icing is documented in 16 presentations.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject of aircraft ice protection has provoked much controversy
and discourse among theorists, designers, laboratory and test
engineers, and flight operations people. In view of this diversity
of opinion and variety of approach, some difficulty has been
experienced in applying current standards and in maintaining
uniformity in the substantiation of aircraft ice protection.
This symposium recognized the need to exchange ideas and it
provided a general review of icing criteria, ice protection
standards, methods of compliance, and service experience. It
also served as a general refresher for Federal Aviation Administration
personnel involved in the evaluation of aircraft ice protection.
Technical papers were presented by government research and test …</p></blockquote>

<h2>A Note</h2>
<p>I briefly worked with Ramon Wilder (circa 1991?), 
but I did not ask him about this particular publication. 
I (a much junior engineer) did off-handedly ask him once about a certain heat conduction equation. 
He said "I'll get back to you." 
The next day he came in with a elegant, hand written, 10 page proof, and said 
"That was a little tough. It took me three hours last night!" 
That was the …</p>

<p>I am not so sure about the "Stalling Speed Increases" part. 
The speed at which the airplane may stall at may decrease due to the effects of ice 
(potentially lower lift at a given airspeed …</p>
