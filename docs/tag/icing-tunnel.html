three methods of cyclic de-icing." src="/images/naca-rm-e53c27/Figure 3.png"></p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Several methods of cyclic de-icing of a gas-heated airfoil were
investigated to determine ice-removal characteristics and heating requirements. 
The cyclic de-icing system with a spanwise ice-free parting strip
in the stagnation region and a constant-temperature gas-supply duct gave
the quickest and most reliable ice removal. Heating requirements for the
several methods of cyclic de-icing are compared, and the savings over
continuous ice prevention are shown. Data are presented to show the
relation of surface temperature, rate of surface heating, and heating
time to the removal of ice.  </p>

<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of low-density ice has been computed from
data obtained in an experimental investigation of the heat transfer and
mass transfer by sublimation for an iced surface on a flat plate in a
high-velocity tangential air stream.  </p>
<p>The results are compared with data from several sources on the
thermal conductivity of packed snow and solid glaze ice. The results
show good agreement with the equations for the thermal conductivity of
packed snow as a function of snow density. The agreement of the curves
for packed snow near the solid ice regime with the values of thermal
conductivity, of ice indicates that the curves are applicable over the
entire-ice-density range.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ice was formed on a full-scale unheated supersonic nose inlet in the

Mach number from 0.10 to 0.47. Icing-cloud liquid-water content was
varied from 0.65 to 1.8 grams per cubic meter at free-stream static air
temperatures of 15° and 0° F.  </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation was conducted to determine the electric power
requirements necessary for ice protection of inlet guide vanes by continuous 
heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show
the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air
velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements
for these two methods of ice protection.<br>
The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 inlet
guide vanes under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide 
a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for
continuous heating. Heat-on periods in the order of 10 seconds with a
cycle ratio of about 1:7 …</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A two-dimensional inlet-guide-vane cascade was investigated to
determine the effects of ice formations on the pressure losses across
the guide vanes and to evaluate the heated gas flow and temperature
required to prevent icing at various conditions. A gas flow of approximately 
0.4 percent of the inlet-air flow was necessary for anti-icing
a hollow guide-vane stage at an inlet-gas temperature of 500° F under
the following icing conditions: air velocity, 280 miles per hour;
water content, 0.9 gram per cubic meter; and inlet-air static temperature, 
0° F. Also presented are the anti-icing gas flows required with

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Supersaturated humidity can affect icing wind tunnel results.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Some observations of supersaturated humidity conditions were made in the NACA-era.  </li>
<li>Supersaturation was associated with frost on test article afterbodies.  </li>
<li>Recirculating icing wind tunnel conditions are calculated to tend to be supersaturated.  </li>
<li>Some potential effects of supersaturation are calculated.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>A brief primer on humidity</h2>
<p>A measurement of water vapor in the air is humidity. 
Relative humidity is the most common measure. 
In everyday life 30% to 60% relative humidity is generally considered to be comfortable. 
Lower humidities feel dry, and higher humidities feel wet or "humid".</p>
<p>The most water vapor that can usually exist at a given static temperature is termed
"saturated", and that condition has 100% relative humidity. 
Given sufficient time and condensation surfaces, 
any surplus vapor above this value will condense as liquid water. </p>

<p>Often, engine icing tests cannot be conducted at conditions that are considered the critical
test points because of aircraft engine test facility operational constraints or the inability to
find the desired conditions in natural icing flight tests. The use of ice scaling laws may
circumvent this testing limitation. Earlier studies (Refs. 1 and 2) of the application of ice
scaling (similitude) to aircraft engine testing indicated that experimental data were needed

<li>Early tests had informal calibrations, partly due to a limited understanding of the natural icing environment.  </li>

<p>As implied from the quote above from the year 1929, 
the calibration of an icing wind tunnel is often not just measuring what the facility produces, 
but also altering and improving the facility to achieve target values for water drop size and 
liquid water content, 
and producing a water drop spray that is uniform "enough". </p>

<h1>"Refrigerated Wind Tunnel Tests on Surface Coatings for Preventing Ice Formation"</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>An early icing wind tunnel and test are described</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>An early icing wind tunnel with most of the components of current tunnels is described.  </li>
<li>A test of several coatings to prevent ice is detailed.  </li>
<li>Many of the points noted about icing tunnel test reflect current test experience.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This investigation was conducted in the Refrigerated Wind
Tunnel at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley
Field, Virginia, to determine the effectiveness of various surface 
coatings as a means
for preventing ice formations on aircraft in flight.
The substances used as coatings for these tests are divided
into two groups:
compounds soluble in water, and those which are insoluble in water.
It was found that certain soluble compounds were apparently
effective in preventing the formation …</p></blockquote>

showing ice formed at Mach 1.35 on top surface behind shoulder." src="images/naca-tn-3396/Figure6.png">  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Predictions of the icing limit temperature were "sufficiently accurate" in tests at Mach 1.35. </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Surface temperatures in icing conditions are challenging to measure.  </li>
<li>Apparently small differences in pressure coefficient and recovery factor values are important at high Mach values. </li>
<li>Partial surface wettedness makes comparisons between analysis and test challenging.  </li>
<li>Thermal conduction in the substrate affects runback ice.  </li>
<li>Predictions of the icing limit temperature were "sufficiently accurate" in tests at Mach 1.35.    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Frictional heating resulting from flight at high speeds effectively
reduces the value of ambient-air temperatures at which ice forms on aircraft 
surfaces. An experimental study was made of the wet-surface temperature 
and the stream conditions that result in ice-free surfaces for
bodies …</p></blockquote>
