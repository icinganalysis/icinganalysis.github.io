<h2>A Note</h2>
<p>I briefly worked with Ramon Wilder (circa 1991?), 
but I did not ask him about this particular publication. 
I (a much junior engineer) asked him off-handedly about a certain heat conduction equation. 
He said "I'll get back to you." 
The next day he came in with an elegant, hand-written, 10 page proof, and said 
"That was a little tough. It took me three hours last night!" 
That was the kind of engineer …</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>An airline operator survey of ice shapes was conducted.  </li>
<li>A residual ice shape was tested at near full scale.  </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In connection with the general study of icing problems 
an item of major interest is the effect of ice on
the aerodynamic characteristics of a wing.
Of particular interest is the effect of the ice which remains on a wing,
under some flight conditions in spite of the operation of
rubber de-icers.
At the request of the N.A.C.A. a questionnaire seeking …</p></blockquote>

<p>The drag and interference caused by protuberance
from the surface of an airfoil have been determined in the
N.A.C.A. Variable-Density Wind Tunnel at a Reynolds
Number of approximately 3,100,000. The effects of variations
of the fore-and-aft position, height, and shape of

of th various protuberances extending along the entire
