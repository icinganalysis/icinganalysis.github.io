<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper summarizes some of the techniques used in N.A.C.A. research programs, 
in flight and in tunnels, to solve aircraft icing problems and it indicates 
the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing protection systems. 
Sufficient data have been obtained, generalized where possible, and techniques have 
been established whereby icing-protection requirements for most aircraft components 
can be determined sufficiently accurately for engineering purposes. 
The Appendices discuss the icing facilities at the N.A.C.A. Lewis laboratory in detail, 
specific test equipment and techniques used in conducting tests in icing wind tunnels, 
and several icing instruments.  </p>

<p>This paper considers the performance penalty caused by icing during climb 
in terms of reduction in rate of climb and in range for aircraft without 
airframe icing protection. It should be noted that the paper is intended

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The formation of ice on aircraft in flight is caused by the freezing 
of supercooled liquid -water droplets as they strike the exposed surfaces
of the aircraft. Icing conditions exist, therefore, when free water 
in the liquid state is present in the air at temperatures below
freezing.<br>
Such conditions are frequently found in clouds, but not all clouds 
at subfreezing temperatures produce icing.
Some clouds are composed
entirely of ice crystals, which, in the absence of liquid water, do not
adhere to the aircraft and therefore do not cause icing.
Subfreezing
clouds thus may be divided into three classes depending on whether they
are composed of ice crystals, liquid-water droplets, or a mixture of
crystals and drops.
The latter two types, liquid and mixed clouds, are
icing clouds …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The state of the art in 1969 of aircraft icing is documented in 16 presentations.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject of aircraft ice protection has provoked much controversy
and discourse among theorists, designers, laboratory and test
engineers, and flight operations people. In view of this diversity
of opinion and variety of approach, some difficulty has been
experienced in applying current standards and in maintaining
uniformity in the substantiation of aircraft ice protection.
This symposium recognized the need to exchange ideas and it
provided a general review of icing criteria, ice protection
standards, methods of compliance, and service experience. It
also served as a general refresher for Federal Aviation Administration
personnel involved in the evaluation of aircraft ice protection.
Technical papers were presented by government research and test …</p></blockquote>
