<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>SUMMARY<br>
Rotating-cylinder measurements of the icing conditions encountered
in flight during the winter of 1947-48 are presented. Liquid-water
content, drop size, and temperature data are shown to be consistent
with previously measured conditions and with proposed
maximum icing conditions in supercooled layer-type clouds.
Cumulative-frequency graphs of meteorological
parameters indicate the frequency
with which various icing conditions have been encountered in the
Great Lakes area and surrounding states.  </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>One of the problems closely associated with the development of
adequate and practicable thermal ice-prevention equipment for airplanes
is the determination of the range of the pertinent meteorological
variables that occur in icing conditions likely to be
encountered during flight. One phase of the basic research on aircraft
icing problems conducted by the NACA has therefore been an attempt to
find and to fly in natural icing conditions for the
purpose of measuring the meteorological
factors associated with supercooled clouds.  </p>
<p>Complete information concerning the fundamental physical
processes that determine the structure of clouds and cloud systems
has necessitated a statistical approach to the problem. The
accumulation of considerable meteorological
data over differing geographical
and climatological regions in various weather conditions is
therefore required before the design limits for ice-prevention
systems can be stated with reasonable certainty.  </p>
<p>APPARATUS AND METHOD  </p>
<p>Rotating-Cylinder Measurements  </p>
<p>Measurements of liquid water content, mean-effective drop
diameter, and drop-size distribution were calculated from the
weight of ice collected on each of four rotating aluminum cylinders
of 1/8, 1/2, 1 1/4, and 3-inch diameters. The procedure used to calculate
the desired quantities was similar to that outlined in reference 6,
except that a density of 0.8 was assumed for all be deposits
in calculating the average cylinder diameter during the exposure
period. Because of flight conditions, this procedure was used in
place of the more tedious, but slightly more accurate, method of
measurement of the thickness of the ice deposited on each cylinder.
For all computations the velocity in the vicinity of the cylinders.
was assumed equal to the true airspeed of the airplane. Once a
desired icing condition was encountered, as many runs as possible
were made in order to approximate a continuous record of the cloud
characteristics.</p>
<p>Free Air Temperature  </p>
<p>Flight temperature measurements were made by means of a
resistance-bulb thermometer shielded to eliminate radiation effects
and direct impact of water. The thermometer was subject to kinetic
heating because of the speed of the airplane. Corrections for the
kinetic heating were obtained by the procedure outlined in reference 4.  </p>

<p>Comparison of Data with Proposed Design Conditions  </p>

to be encountered in flight are contained in reference 4. The

<p>Examination
of table I and figure 1 indicates that these proposed maximum conditions
were neither equalled nor exceeded during
the 1947-48 season. Whereas the first cylinder run of ice conditions
approximates the estimated maximum conditions with respect
to liquid-water content and temperature, the decreased collection
efficiency of exposed airfoil surfaces due to the small drops
considerably lessened the rate of ice formation.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frequency-Distribution of Meteorological Parameters  </p>
<p>During the two seasons of ice flights from the Lewis laboratory,
31 flights were made in icing conditions during which
93 rotating-cylinder observations were collected. Nearly all the
data were gathered in layer-type clouds, including nine observations
in alto-stratus. Owing to the procedure of attempting to find, and
to fly as long as possible, in the heavier-icing conditions, the
data are believed to be weighted in favor of the more severe conditions
that existed in the Great Lakes area and surrounding states.
An ogive (emulative-frequency curve) based on observations of
liquid-water content during the 1946-47 and 1947-48 seasons is shown
in figure 2. A liquid-water content of less than 0.40 gram per cubic
meter was measured in nearly 90 percent of the cases and 50 percent
of all observations were made in conditions with less than 0.18 gram
per cubic meter.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2. Ogive of 93 observations of liquid-water content in 
icing clouds measured during 31 winter flights during 1946-47 and 1947-48.
" src="images%2FNACA-TN-1793%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<p>The ogive of drop-size measurements in figure 3 indicates that
about 90 percent of the measurements of mean-effective
diameter of
the drops in icing clouds were less than 20 microns and 50 percent
were less than 13 microns. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Because the actual icing intensity observed in flight is related
to both the concentration of supercooled
water and the drop sizes, computations
have been made of the theoretical rate of ice accretion
on a 3-inch-diameter cylinder, which roughly approximates
the leading edge of at least part of an airplane wing. Although no simple
measure of icing intensity is adequate for engineering purposes,
the use of a 3-inch cylinder as a reference for icing-intensity
measurements relates the observations to conditions that would
normally be observed by a pilot.  </p>
<p>Values for the collection efficiency
for a 3-inch cylinder for various drop sizes were taken from reference 6.
Figure 4 indicates that 90 percent of all measured icing
conditions caused an icing rate of less than 3 grams per square centimeter
per hour (1.5 in./hr, with an ice density of O.8). One-half
of the observations were in icing conditions of less than 1.3 grams
per square centimeter per hour (0.6 in./hr). The maximum condition
observed so far has been 5.3 grams per square centimeter per hour,
which is equivalent to about 2.6 inches per hour. The maximum
design conditions for layer-type clouds specified in reference 4 give
a computed icing rate of approximately 4 inches per hour when related
to a 3-inch-diameter cylinder.  </p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following general conclusions are based on the observations
gathered during two winter of icing flights from the Lewis laboratory:<br>
1. In supercooled layer clouds that exist over the Great Lakes area, 
icing intensities are usually light (based upon the U. S. 
Weather Bureau scale of icing intensity in reporting icing conditions 
at mountain stations) but may occasionally approach an icing rate 
of moderate intensity.<br>
2. Data collected during the two seasons indicate that the 
specifications of maximum  icing conditions in terms of liquid-water 
content, mean-effective drop diameter, and temperature previously 
proposed for supercooled layer-type clouds appear to be adequate 
for the Great Lakes and surrounding regions.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Icing intensity scales</h3>
<p>The Weather Bureau scale of icing intensity was used as a reference of comparison 
for measured icing conditions. The rationale was perhaps succinctly summarized later by
Uwe von Glahn in 1955 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The collection of ice by the cylinders is similar to the collection of ice by airplane components. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The utility of the historic Weather Bureau scale of icing intensity or more recent 
icing intensity characterizations has been questioned.  </p>
<p>Jeck <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (2001) wrote of "Much confusion...":  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This report traces the evolution of aircraft icing severity definitions and of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations governing flight in icing conditions in order to understand the
intent of each and how they relate to each other. There have been several changes in both the
definitions and the regulations over time, and part of the problem is that the definitions have not
been updated or clarified to account for current regulations. Much confusion has resulted and, in
order to improve the situation, new and updated definitions have been recently proposed by a new
working group established as part of the 1997 FAA In-Flight Icing Plan.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proposal by Jeck has not been widely adopted. </p>
<p>The later SAE "Aircraft Inflight Icing Terminology" <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> (reaffirmed in 2013) states:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>FAA publications currently contain a number of different definitions of icing intensity. 
In addition, new suggested definitions have been published by the FAA in the 
Federal Register but are not yet incorporated in any rules or advisory material.<br>
...<br>
This situation makes it inadvisable for SAE to recommend any definition of icing intensity terms at this time for the following reasons:<br>
1. The current definitions in the Aeronautical Information Manual are unsatisfactory. 
The FAA has acknowledged their shortcomings in proposing these new definitions.<br>
2. The intensity definitions have regulatory implications, 
as the terms are contained in the FAA operating rules.<br>
3. The eventual inclusion of these definitions in the </p>
<p>The eventual inclusion of these definitions in the Aeronautical Information Manual 
will probably not be sufficient by itself 
for SAE to recommend their use. As stated in the Federal Register, 
use of the new definitions requires revisions of FAA regulations and 
advisory material and collaboration with the National Weather Service 
to achieve changes in forecasting consistent with these definitions. 
These are likely to be lengthy processes and may result in changes to the 
new suggested definitions.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not aware of significant changes to the icing intensity definitions since 2013.  </p>
