<p>Icing conditions for the design of equipment are proposed, which are later part of Appendix C.  </p>

<li>Classes of icing conditions are proposed.  </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Meteorological conditions conducive to aircraft icing are 
arranged in four classifications: three are associated with cloud 
structure and the fourth with freezing rain. The range of possible 
meteorological factors for each classification is discussed and 
specific values recommended for consideration in the design of 
ice-prevention equipment for aircraft are selected and tabulated. The 
values selected are based upon a study of the available observational 
data and theoretical considerations where observations are lacking. 
Recommendations for future research in the field are presented.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Design procedures have recently been established for the computation 
of the heat requirements for the protection of wings and 
windshields of aircraft operating in icing conditions (references 
1 and 2); however, their use is dependent upon a knowledge of
such factors as the amount of liquid water in the icing cloud and 
the average diameter of the cloud drops. Progress in the application 
of these procedures has been handicapped by the lack of sufficient 
data on the meteorological factors. To overcome this difficulty, 
considerable research in the laboratory and in flight has
been undertaken independently by various civil Government agencies, 
the armed services, universities, and private concerns. This 
research has progressed to a point where a tentative listing of 
icing conditions for design purposes can be attempted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term "icing condition" as used herein denotes a state of the 
 atmosphere defined by a set of values of temperature, liquid—water 
 content, drop diameter, and pressure altitude in which the temperature 
 is below freezing and the liquid-water content is greater than 
 zero.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 1 is NACA-TN-1472, which was <a href="/naca-tn-1472.html">reviewed in the Thermodynamics Thread
</a>. Reference 2 is NACA-TN-1434, 
which was <a href="/windshield-ice-protection.html">reviewed in the Ice Protection Thread</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The preparation of such a list was undertaken with the view in 
mind of providing as complete a coverage as possible, within the 
probable flight range. It is not intended that each icing condition 
tabulated should be specified as a design requirement for all components 
of the airplane, but rather that each condition be considered as a 
possible meteorological situation to be encountered and, 
therefore, worthy of some attention. For example, the designer, 
having a certain component of the airplane in mind, should review 
the listing to determine which icing conditions would probably affect 
that component and, therefore, should be included in the design 
calculation. For his part, the operator should consider the listing 
as indicative of the wide variation of conditions through which his 
aircraft might be called upon to operate.</p>
<p>This report is based upon a paper which was originally prepared 
for the NACA Subcommittee on Icing Problems, Committee on Operating 
Problems, for discussion at a meeting held at the Lewis Flight 
Propulsion Laboratory, Cleveland, Ohio, on October 18, 1948. The 
purpose of the paper was to propose values of design icing conditions 
based on currently available data, and to indicate required further 
research. This report incorporates suggestions advanced by members 
of the Subcommittee during the meeting. The authors are also 
indebted to Mr. J. K. Hardy of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, 
Farnborough, England, for helpful comments which aided materially in 
the preparation of the report.</p>
<p>GENERAL CLASSES OF FLIGHT ICING CONDITIONS  </p>
<p>Experience in icing research has shown that the selection of 
meteorological conditions for the design of aircraft ice-prevention
equipment is influenced somewhat by the particular component to be 
protected. For example, air—induction systems,in general, and 
turbine engine intakes, in particular, are most critically affected 
by an encounter with an icing condition of high liquid—water content,
even though the duration of the encounter is very short. In contrast, 
propellers, wings, empennages, and windshields, if provided with 
adequate protection for continuous icing conditions, can usually 
tolerate brief and intermittent encounters with conditions of greater 
severity. In fact, the assumption of continuous flight at icing 
conditions known to be associated only with discontinuous clouds for 
these latter components would be unduly conservative and unjustified.</p>
<p>Flight icing conditions have been divided into four general 
classes for the purposes of this study. The first three classes are 
confined to cloud forms and are associated with the duration of an 
encounter with the condition. Since the duration of flight in an 
icing condition is dependent upon the flight speed, the more basic 
concept of horizontal extent of the condition will be utilized 
herein. This is readily convertible to duration at any selected 
flight speed. The fourth class of icing condition is the special 
case of freezing rain. A brief description of the characteristics 
of each class is given below, together with an example of the airplane 
component or feature to which the class applies in design considerations. 
The selection of values of the meteorological variables 
to be assigned to each class will be discussed in a later section.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>              Class I

  Designation: Instantaneous.
  Horizontal extent: 1/2 mile.3
  Duration at 180 miles per hour: 10 seconds.

 This should not be taken to imply that these conditions are 
 necessarily limited to areas 1/2 mile in extent. This value was 
 chosen because it is believed that the most severe conditions 
 likely to be encountered are approximately uniform over a distance 
 of about 1/2 mile. The distance across the upper portion of a 
 single cumulus tower is ordinarily from 1 to 3 miles and rarely 
 exceeds 5 miles. Average values of liquid—water content up to
 80 percent of the 1/2—mile maximum may occasionally be expected 
 for distances up to 3 miles.

Characteristic: Very high liquid-water content.

Applicable to: Any part of the airplane, such as guide vanes 
      in interior ducting, where the sudden collection 
      of a large mass of supercooled water 
      would be critical.

Example: Induction systems, particularly turbine-engine inlets. 

         Class II

Designation: Intermittent.

Horizontal extent: 3 miles.

Duration at 180 miles per hour: 1 minute.

Characteristic: High liquid-water content.

Applicable to: Any critical component of the airplane where 
      ice accretions, even though slight and of short
      duration, could not be tolerated.

Examples: Induction systems, windshields in any case where 
    practically continuous visibility was required.

          Class III

Designation: Continuous.

Horizontal extent and duration: Continuous.

Characteristic: Moderate to low liquid-water content.

Applicable to: All components of the airplane, that is, every 
      part of the airplane should be examined with 
      the question in mind, &quot;Will this part be 
      affected seriously by accretions during continuous 
      flight in icing conditions?&quot;

Example: Wings and tail surfaces.

             Class IV

Designation: Freezing rain.

Horizontal extent: 100 miles.

Duration at 180 miles per hour: About 1/2 hour.

Characteristic: Very large drops at near—freezing temperatures 
        and low values of liquid-vater content.

Applicable to: Components of the airplane for which no protection 
       would be supplied after considering 
       Classes I, II, and III.

Example: Fuselage static—pressure airspeed vents probably 
    would not require protection for Classes I, II, and. 
    III, but might be subject to icing in freezing rain.

<blockquote>
<p>SELECTION OF METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
FOR THE FOUR GENERAL CLASSES</p>
<p>One of the factors of major importance in the selection of 
design icing conditions, and the operation of aircraft in these 
conditions, is the probability of encountering any specified 
meteorological situation. At the time of the preparation of this report 
the statistical analysis of available meteorological data had not 
proceeded to a point where estimates of the likelihood of meeting a 
specified icing condition could be stated. Omission of the probability 
factor from this report was a necessity, therefore, and is not an 
indication that the subject is of secondary importance.</p>
<p>In addition to the four general icing classes already defined, 
the icing conditions were further classified into two groups; namely, 
most probable maximum, and normal or typical. The most probable 
maximum does not represent the maximum that nature could produce, but 
rather the maximum that would probably be encountered in all—weather<br>
aircraft operations. The normal or typical designation refers to the<br>
average or normal conditions to be anticipated in all—weather opera-<br>
tions in the United States. To represent the most probable maximum 
conditions of a class, the letter M was used, for example,
class I—M, II—M, etc. Similarly, the letter N was used for 
normal conditions.</p>

<p>Class II-M.- Intermittent, Maximum</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intermittent class of icing conditions is considered to be 
representative of clouds in which water concentrations about one-half 
as severe as those assigned to the instantaneous class would 
be encountered for durations of about five or six times the
instantaneous class durations. Such conditions can be expected near 
the tops of cumulus clouds in both summer and winter; however, they 
are much more likely to be encountered at temperatures below 
freezing during winter. Because of this fact, and because escape 
from cumulus icing in summer can often be made by a descent to 
warmer altitudes, the winter cumulus conditions have been selected 
as the basis for the suggested values of the intermittent class 
icing conditions.  </p>
<p>The selection of values for class II is based partly on the 
discussion in reference 5. The values proposed therein are the 
result of an estimate of the maximum liquid-water content likely 
to be encountered during winter and the lowest temperature and 
largest drop size likely to occur with the chosen value of water 
content. In the selection of the values presented in table I, it
was considered desirable to include several combinations of temperature 
and drop diameter and to specify for each the probable maximum 
liquid-water content. The values selected were determined from an 
examination of scatter diagrams similar to figures 5 and 8 of 
reference 5, but incorporating all available data, including the 
1947-48 Ames Laboratory observations. These conditions are listed 
as items 11 to 25, inclusive, in table I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 5 is <a href="/naca-tn-1393.html">NACA-TN-1393</a>.</p>
<p>Class III-M.- Continuous, Maximum</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conditions in this class, which occur in layer-type clouds, 
have been discussed in references 5 and 6. Sufficient data are now 
available to estimate with reasonable accuracy the variation of 
maximum liquid-water content in layer clouds with both temperature 
and drop size. Suggested values are presented as items 31 to 45, 
inclusive, table I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 6 is <a href="/naca-tn-1424.html">NACA-TN-1424</a>.  </p>
<p>For the class "IV - M Freezing Rain":   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observational data are not available for this class, since, in 
the only case in which data have been taken, the water content of the<br>
rain was too low to measure in the presence of the clouds through 
which it was falling. For this reason, the values for the proposed 
condition (item 50, table I) were calculated. They were based on an 
assumed rate of rainfall of 0.10 inch per hour with drops 1 millimeter 
in diameter. The use of 0.10 inch per hour is considered appropriate 
because large-scale continuous precipitation in winter is usually of<br>
light intensity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Suggested Continuation of Formative Research on Conditions Conducive to Icing  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extend flight research as required to establish whether the 
values of table I, which are based on winter flights and confined, 
for the most part, to northern United States, are representative of 
conditions everywhere. Conditions for which it would be of immediate<br>
interest to know the meteorological quantities are the low—temperature 
continuous icing associated with operations in Alaska and the 
Arctic, the conditions existing in the top of large summer cumulus 
clouds, and the conditions during summer in all types of clouds at 
altitudes above the freezing level. It is also desirable to eventually 
extend the scope of observations to include the entire world, 
since there may be important regional differences in cloud characteristics 
such as the difference in prevailing drop size between 
central and eastern United States and the Pacific coast area which 
is indicated in the data taken by the Ames Laboratory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain flight data on instantaneous values of maximum 
liquid—water content, drop size, temperature, and altitude.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain flight data to establish drop—size distribution 
in clouds.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain necessary data in flight through icing clouds for 
confirmation or modification of the method of assuming adiabatic 
lifting and no mixing for the calculation of liquid-water content 
at any level in a cloud.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suggested Statistical Research on Conditions Conducive to Icing  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Analyze all available meteorological icing data obtained 
in flight by statistical procedures to establish, at least
tentatively, the probability of encountering a specified icing 
condition.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain measurements of liquid—water content, drop diameter 
(mean effective, at least, and maximum, if possible), temperatures, 
and altitude during regular military and commercial operations 
whenever icing conditions are encountered. Time and geographical 
location should also be recorded in order that the data may be 
analyzed with reference to the synoptic weather situation.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The class "II-M Intermittent, Maximum" and "III-M Continuous, Maximum" values 
are noted in the current CFR 14 Part 25 Appendix C icing conditions definitions <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>For the class "IV - M Freezing Rain", a similar requirement was not incorporated into Appendix C. 
The assumption was apparently that if equipment was protected for other classes of icing, 
then performance might be adequate in freezing rain. Status pressure ports were the 
only equipment listed to be considered against freezing rain. 
It was not until 2014 that freezing rain requirements were incorporated into the new 
Appendix O of CFR 14 Part 25 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>Several of the suggested research tasks would be accomplished over the next 
several years. 
We will review those in the upcoming Conclusions of the Icing Meteorology Thread. </p>
