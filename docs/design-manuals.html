<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The knowledge of aircraft icing matured to produce engineering design manuals.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>NACA publications contributed heavily to later design manuals.  </li>
<li>Extensive design publications distilling research into practical methods appeared in the 1950s.  </li>
<li>I do not know of a comprehensive design resource for some recent topics such as 3D design and analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>NACA had an early period (up to and including WWII) 
that was largely characterized by expeditious tests to 
address immediate icing problems. 
Later, NACA embarked on more scientifically oriented studies. 
The science and experience of aircraft ice protection had matured enough 
by the 1950s for comprehensive engineering design manuals to be written.  </p>
<p>While NACA did not write all of the design manuals, 
all of the design manuals heavily relied on NACA references. 
Half of the references in ADS-4 
"Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data" are NACA references, 
and the main author, Dean Bowden, had published NACA icing papers. </p>
<p>The breadth of knowledge encapsulated in ADS-4 allowed the expansive 
claim in 1963:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An aircraft engineer can use this report to design adequate ice protection systems for any type aircraft for any flight mission profile."  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other design manuals led up to ADS-4. </p>
<h2>"Modern Icing Technology" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></h2>
<p>While not labeled a design guide, 
this publication had most of the parts one might expect in a design guide. 
Think of this as an excellent first draft for later design manuals. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOREWORD<br>
These notes are the outgrowth of a seminar on icing information 
given at the University of Michigan in the Fall of 1951. 
They are intended to be useful to the persons 
interested in entering the icing field who require a single source 
where either basic information or suitable references may be found.  </p>
<p>This first edition was rather hurriedly put together for use 
in a seconds seminar in February, 1952. Corrections and suggested 
additions will be most welcome. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For being "rather hurriedly put together", 
this is an extensive resource (153 pages). </p>

<p>This was the most comprehensive airplane icing education 
(other than reading every NACA publication on the topic) available in 1952. </p>
<p>Apparently, all sections were presented by Tribus. 
Sections IV and V on energy transfers borrowed from Bernard L. Messinger's 
<a href="/messinger.html">"Equilibrium Temperature of an Unheated Icing Surface as a Function of Airspeed"</a>, 
perhaps the most frequently cited reference on aircraft icing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Messinger has used these functions to prepare graphs showing the
effects of speed on wing temperatures. Figure V-10 is taken from Messinger's
paper and shows the free stream velocity required to prevent freezing at
various free air temperatures. The required speed increases with increasing
altitude.<br>
Figure V-11, also taken from Messinger's paper, shows the variations
in surface temperature as a function of airspeed. Although b is shown as an
independent parameter, b is also a function of airspeed. In laminar regions
b varies almost as the square root of velocity. In turbulent regions b varies
When ice is forming the value of more nearly with the 0.2 power of velocity.
b changes due to the effect of the distortion of the streamlines. Both the
water catch and unit thermal conductance will thus be changed in an unpredictable fashion.</p>

<h2>Airplane Icing Information Course <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h2>
<p>"Modern Icing Technology" formed a basis for the Airplane Icing Information Course that was 
held the next year, 1953. 
Several invited speakers led sessions on numerous topics. 
One of those was Bernard L. Messinger with "Energy Exchanges During Icing". 
Apparently Tribus' earlier use of the work of Messinger was approved of. 
I plan a future thread on the Airplane Icing Information Course. </p>
<p>One of the topics in the 1953 Airplane Icing Information Course was 
"air-heated systems for the continuous prevention of ice formation", 
NACA-TN-3130, which was a design manual, and we will cover it below. </p>
<h2>"The Design of Air-Heated Ice-Prevention Systems" NACA-TN-3130 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY
A procedure proposed for use in the design of air-heated systems
for the continuous prevention of ice formation on airplane components is
set forth. Required heat-transfer and air-pressure-loss equations are
presented, and methods of selecting appropriate meteorological conditions
for flight over specified geographical areas and for the calculation of
water-drop-impingement characteristics are suggested.<br>
In order to facilitate the design, a simple electrical analogue was
devised which solves the complex heat-transfer relationships existing in
the thermal-system analysis. The analogue is described and an illustration 
of its application to design is given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This goes into much detail (64 pages). </p>
<p>Thermal analysis in 2D was performed. 
Figure 15 shows the control volumes used. 
Figure 17 shows the circuit diagram of the electrical analog.

<h2>"A Design Manual for Thermal Anti-Icing Systems", WADC Techical Report 54-313 <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></h2>
<p>This design manual was put together by the Wright Air Development Center, 
a US Army Air Force (later Air Force) base. 
This is quite extensive (303 pages).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT
This manual deals with the thermal anti-icing of aircraft wing and
tail surfaces which are protected by double-skin heaters. After a brief
introduction, reference material is presented for pressure drop of duct
components, water impingement on airfoils, and coefficients of heat and
mass transfer by convection. The last parts of the manual are devoted to
mass and heat balance on airfoils and to a design procedure presented
from the viewpoint of performance analysis.</p>
<p>Chapter I INTRODUCTION<br>
Scope and Objectives.<br>
This manual deals with steady-state, or continuous-, thermal anti-icing 
of wing and tail surfaces. The heating medium of any system considered 
here is assumed to be hot air flowing along inner surfaces of the
skin, that is, through so-called double-skin heat exchangers.<br>
Specific objectives of the manual are to provide methods and reference
material for the design of continuous thermal anti-icing systems in wings
and empennages insofar as the thermal design is to be considered. Other
aspects of the design, such as the selection of a heat source, the performance 
of the power plant during icing conditions, the effect on range of
flight, the economic aspects, etc, are not treated here but may be found
in other places. For example, Tribus (Ref. 124, Chapter III) deals with
some of these problems.<br>
While only anti-icing is being considered, a large amount of the
reference material, such as the data from calculation of waterdrop
trajectories, may be used for calculations, on mechanical, chemical, and
cyclic de-icing systems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference 124 is Tribus' "Modern Icing Technologies", which we saw above. 
Messinger is (of course) also referenced, as well as NACA-TN-3130. </p>
<p>While many of the 133 citations are NACA publications, there are 
many from ASME and other sources that concern the movement of air in pipes. 
This shows a maturation of the design process. 
While much analysis concerns the outer surface of a wing
(ambient air flow and water drop impingement), which is often performed by an aerodynamics group, 
much of what gets "designed" in such an ice protection system is what is inside the wing, 
which is often the provence of an air conditioning group that is familiar with duct design.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2-4. Total-Pressure-Loss Coefficients for Elbows." src="images%2FWADC%2054-313%2FFigure%202-4.png">  </p>
<p>Almost half of the pages are on water drop catch efficiency, 
and there are many figures similar to figure 3-12.  </p>

would receive heat at the rate h_a*(a+2*b)*(t_a-t_c). However, some parts 
of the fin are at temperatures higher than t_c, and so only a fraction of 
this heat is actually picked up. This fraction, denoted by eta and 
called fin effectiveness, may be evaluated by means of the equation

<p>We already reviewed part of <a href="/ads-4.html">ADS-4</a>. 
Rather than the 2D analysis of NACA-TN-3130, ADS-4 describes a 
1D analysis where ice protection performance on a surface (upper or lower wing)
is described with a single, averaged control volume (from <a href="/naca-tn-2799.html">NACA-TN-2799</a>). </p>
<p>The other sections go well beyond the thermal aspects, 
and provide much information to help avoid 
"details which have not been anticipated before the de-icing tests were started". </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>By 1963 the comprehensive ADS-4 was available. 
Aircraft icing was largely viewed as a "solved" problem. 
NACA had been subsumed by NASA, 
and NASA resources were largely devoted to other tasks, such as space exploration
(ADS-4 was published by the FAA, not NASA). </p>
<p>The <a href="/the-greatest-thing-that-you-have-probably-never-read-1969-aircraft-ice-protection-report-of-symposium.html">1969 Aircraft Ice Protection Symposium</a> 
sponsored by the FAA had 16 presentations. 
Two were by former NACA employees, and presented prior work. 
The new data presented were from other entities, 
such as industry and the US Air Force. 
<a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a> also had 
its first appearance at the symposium, 
and was still relevant when republished in 1981.<br>
The Selected Bibliography includes ADS-4, even though it is not a 
NACA or NASA publication. </p>
<p>“Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection” part of the SAE Applied Thermodynamics Manual <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>, 
was first published in 1969. It covers many of the same topics as ADS-4. 
The current version is listed as "stabilized" by the SAE, 
which means it will not be revised unless a need arises
(rather than reviewed every 5 years, like many active documents). 
People say that they still use it. 
It is frankly getting dated. While nothing in it is wrong, 
it does not address many current design tools and challenges such as 
3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) icing analysis. </p>
<p>If “Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection” is getting dated, 
I am partly to blame, as I have served on the SAE AC9C 
Aircraft Icing Technology committee that sponsors the document. 
We have not found the motivation for the extensive 
re-write that might be required to address recent topics. </p>
<p>Recent topics are being addressed in other avenues. 
The AIAA has an Ice Prediction Workshop <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> that addresses 3D ice shape tools, 
but not ice protection, and it is planned to last several more years, 
and has not yielded something like a new design manual. </p>
<p>Some day I might write a review of the “Aircraft Icing Handbook" <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>, 
but not today. It is also perhaps a little dated. 
The abstract discusses ADS-4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Periodically the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) provides documentation to assist regulatory certification teams and industry design engineers
in standardizing testing and validating procedures. Examples of such documentation are 
"Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data" FAA Report
No. ADS-4 dated December 1964. and
"EngineeringSummary of Powerplant Icing Technical Data." FAA
Report No. RD-77-76,
dated July 1977. Although most of the information contained in these reports is still valid. some is outdated. and
more usable information is now available through recent research and experience. Therefore. this
work was directed towards developing an updated and more comprehensive combined version of
Report ADS-4 and RD-77-76 that includes reference material on ground and airborne icing facilities.
simulation procedures and analytical techniques. This document represents all types and classes of
aircraft and is intended as a working tool for the designer and analyst of ice protection
systems.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ADS-4 was the predominant design reference for decades. 
The DOT/FAA “Aircraft Icing Handbook” <sup id="fnref2:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> was published in 1991, 
and re-used large portions of ADS-4. </p>
<p>I have used many of the methods from ADS-4. 
While nomographs and 1D analysis may seem simplistic, 
they yield reliable results. I have also used 3D analysis tools. 
Frankly, if the 3D results do not agree with 1D analysis by, say, 
+/20 % I would re-check what I did in the 3D analysis. </p>
<p>ADS-4 has been used for decades, and is a crowning achievement of the NACA-era.  </p>
