<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The thermal analysis of icing conditions has unique challenges, 
including the determination of heat transfer coefficients and fraction of the surface wetted.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Measured heat transfer coefficients in dry air can be different between flight and tunnel tests, due to free stream turbulence. </li>
<li>Icing conditions tend to promote more turbulent flow on the surface.  </li>
<li>Assumptions about the fraction of the surface wetted aft of impingement affect the thermal analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit can be made, there is more that can be done in
any kind of a flowing stream if <strong>ice formation can be redefined in more general terms
as a thermodynamic problem</strong>.   </p>

(let us say prior to about 1949) 
to a more general and analytical understanding of icing.  </p>
<p>The study of icing is complex,

<h2>NACA-TN-2480, "Comparison of Heat Transfer from Airfoil in Natural and Simulated Icing Conditions" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
An investigation of the heat transfer from an airfoil in clear
air and in simulated icing conditions was conducted in the NACA Lewis
6- by 9-foot icing-research tunnel in order to determine the validity
of heat-transfer data as obtained in the tunnel. This investigation
was made on the same model NACA 65,2-016 airfoil section used in a
previous flight study, under similar heating, icing, and operating
conditions.<br>
The effect of tunnel turbulence, in clear air and in icing was
indicated by the forward movement of transition from laminar to turbulent 
heat transfer. An analysis of the flight results showed the
convective heat transfer in icing to be considerably different from
that measured in clear air and only slightly different from that
obtained in the icing-research tunnel during simulated icing.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
The determination of the heat required for the protection of aircraft 
in icing has been the subject of considerable research by the
NACA for a number of years. For specific aircraft, the heat required
to realize an arbitrary temperature rise above the free-stream air
temperature of the airplane surfaces that are subject to icing is
determined, in reference 1. The development by Hardy (reference 2) of
an analysis of the heat transfer from an airplane surface during
icing provides a means of computing the heat requirements for specified 
icing conditions. The flight tests reported in reference 3 provide 
results for limited conditions, which, in general, substantiate
the analysis of Hardy.<br>
Icing investigations conducted in flight are difficult to control 
and time consuming. An investigation of the heat transfer from
an airfoil in clear air and in icing over a range of controlled conditions 
was therefore conducted in the NACA Lewis icing-research tunnel.<br>
A comparison of the heat-transfer results obtained in the icing-research 
tunnel with those obtained in flight using the same model
airfoil and operating at similar conditions is presented herein.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT<br>
The model used in the tunnel investigation was an NACA 65,2-016
airfoil section having an 8-foot chord and a 6-foot span. With minor
modifications required for the tunnel installation, it was the same
model used in a flight investigation in natural icing conditions and
is fully described in reference 3. The airfoil was vertically mounted
in the tunnel as shown in figure 1. Construction details of the
1-foot-span electrically heated test section are given in figure 2.
The 20 groups of heating elements in this area were arranged into
11 electric circuits selected to provide the most flexible chordwise
adjustment of power distribution within the limits of the available
facilities. The differences in power readings for heating elements
common to the same circuit are caused by differences in resistance.
This arrangement permitted a chordwise power distribution similar to
that employed in the flight investigations. The heated length of the
test strip extended to 55 percent of the chord length on the left side
of the airfoil and to 17 percent of the chord length on the right side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simulated icing conditions were obtained in the test section of
the tunnel by introducing liquid water into the air stream from eight
NACA air-atomizing nozzles placed in four steam-heated struts located
upstream of the tunnel test section. Initially the spray system was
placed in the tunnel contraction section approximately 22 feet upstream
of the model. For most of the investigation, the spray nozzles were
located in the low-velocity section of the tunnel with a mixing distance 
from the nozzles to the model of 48 feet (fig. 3). The liquid-water 
content of the icing cloud was varied from approximately 0.3 to
1.5 grams per cubic meter by adjusting the nozzle water pressure; the
mean-effective droplet diameter was varied from about 8 to 12 microns
by adjusting the nozzle-air pressure. Liquid-water content, droplet
size, and droplet-size distribution were determined by the rotating
multicylinder method described in reference 4. The droplet-size distributions 
given in table I and defined in reference 4 are arbitrary
size-frequency distributions based on measurements in natural icing
with the A distribution denoting droplets of a single size.</p>

<p>The spray system was removed for some runs,

<p>Surface-Datum Temperature<br>
For the flight tests, the experimental surface-datum temperatures
are not reported. In the icing-research tunnel, the surface-datum 
temperatures were measured in clear air for each operating condition. A
comparison of the surface-datum temperatures measured in the icing-research 
tunnel in clear air with the value calculated from equation (4)
is shown in figure 5 for condition 10'. The measured temperatures vary
as much as 2 F from the calculated values, which is within the accuracy
of measurement.
The datum temperatures in a cloud that is below freezing cannot be
measured directly because Of the release of heat by the freezing of the
impinging water. For the flight conditions, the wet-datum temperatures
were computed from equation (5). For tunnel conditions, the wet datum
temperatures were calculated by deducting the temperature depression
caused by evaporation from an average of the measured clear-air surface-datum 
temperatures.</p>

<p>Impingement and Evaporation
Records of the impingement and the water flow over the airfoil
surface were obtained by placing a water-sensitive material on the forward 
portion of the airfoil model. Typical records of this type are
shown in figure 6. The results obtained in the tunnel and in flight
were substantially the same. The solid areas on the records of figure 6 
are the regions of direct water impingement in which the surface
was fully wetted. Downstream of the limit of direct impingement the
water breaks into individual streams or rivulets that tend to decrease
in size and number. The weight rate of water impingement for one side
of the airfoil model in pounds per hour per foot span and the limits
of impingement were calculated for each condition by use of the water-droplet 
trajectories for a symmetrical, 12-percent-thick Joukowaki
airfoil. The results of these calculations are given in table II.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the partly wetted area downstream of direct impingement, the
rate of evaporation per unit area is less than in the fully wetted
area. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the evaporation process
in this partly wetted area, the full evaporation rate was decreased by
a factor equal to the percentage of the total surface area that is
actually wetted. From the flight and the tunnel records of impingement
and runback as shown in figure 6, the actual area wetted by the runback
rivulets was measured at various surface distances downstream of the
limits of impingement. The results of these measurements are shown
in figure 7. The wetness factor K decreases sharply from a value of
1 at the limit of impingement to a mean value of approximately 25 percent 
1-inch downstream of the impingement limit and decreases slowly
thereafter. The tunnel and flight measurements show agreement, which
indicates that the flow process is substantially the same. Within
the range of conditions investigated, no significant variation of the
wetness factor with limit of impingement was noted. The actual degree
of wetness probably does not follow a smooth curve. Although figure 6
reveals that several of the rivulets either stop or merge rather
abruptly, in the hèat-transfer calculations of this report the wetness
factor was regarded as continuously decreasing with distance as indicated 
in figure 7. Further refinement does not appear warranted from
the data and lack of information regarding the evaporation process in
this runback area. The calculated rates of evaporation and the limits
of runback for each of the flight and the tunnel icing conditions are
presented in table II.  </p>

<p>Effect of Tunnel and Spray System in Clear Air<br>
The initial heat-transfer measurements in the icing tunnel were
made in clear air in order to determine the effect of the tunnel and
the inoperative spray system on the convective heat-transfer coefficient. 
The results of these measurements are given in figure 8, which
presents the heat flow from the surface, the heated and unheated surface 
temperatures, and the convective heat-transfer coefficient. The
heat distribution used was experimentally determined as that producing 
an approximately uniform surface temperature.<br>
When the spray system was not in the tunnel (fig. 8), raising the
tunnel true airspeed from 138 to 194 miles per hour had no measurable
effect on the location of the minimum convective heat-transfer coefficient, 
which remained at about 8-percent chord, whereas the location
of the maximum coefficient moved forward from approximately 28- to 24-percent chord.</p>

<p>Additional Tunnel Results<br>
In addition to the tunnel investigation in which the flight heat
distribution was used, studies were made with heat distributions that
gave uniform surface temperatures in clear air and also in simulated.

clear air in the icing-research tunnel have already been presented in
figure 9(c). The thermal data obtained with this same heat distribution 
during icing in the tunnel are given for condition 11' in
figure 15. The original surface temperature, which was approximately
70 F in clear air, was sharply reduced in the first 20 percent of
chord and a minimum temperature of 25° F was obtained, which resulted
in ice formations. Photographs of these ice formations are shown in
figure 16. The heat-transfer results are presented in the Nusselt
correlation form in figure 17(a) together with a comparison with the
clear-air curve. A marked forward movement of transition resulted
from operation in icing with the actual transition beginning at
approximately 2 percent of chord (fig. 15). The turbulent curve downstream 
of the ice formation follows the slope of the theoretical turbulent 
curve from equation (12), but is approximately 18 percent higher
than the curve obtained in clear air at the same condition.</p>

<p>Comparison of Tunnel and Flight Results<br>
A comparison of the tunnel and flight results is shown in figure 19 
for icing conditions 1 and 8. These conditions had approximately 
the same true airspeed, free-stream temperature, and limit of
impingement; the same flight heat distribution that resulted in non-uniform 
surface temperatures in icing was used for both. No comparison is made 
for the case of uniform surface temperatures in icing
inasmuch as such results were not obtained in the flight investigation.
The greatest discrepancy between the tunnel and flight results of figure 
19 occurs in the laminar region at a local Reynolds number of
3X10^5 and in the turbulent region at a local Reynolds number of 3X10^6
where large peaks for both flight and tunnel result from sudden
increases in heat input at this region. In the transition region, a
better comparison is obtained; the tunnel results are approximately 5
to 30 percent higher than the flight results. The data for these two
conditions (figs. 14(a) and 12(c)) show a scatter of approximately
15 percent during transition. In the turbulent region, the results
agree within 10 percent except for the large peaks caused by the discontinuity 
of the heat distribution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The results of the investigation of heat transfer from an airfoil
in the icing-research tunnel may be summarized as follows:<br>
1. The pattern of the runback rivulets and hence the degree of
surface wetness were substantially the same for both the tunnel and
flight results.<br>
2. The inherent turbulence level of the tunnel caused a forward
movement of transition from laminar to turbulent heat transfer in
clear air with a semilaminar region obtained at local Reynolds numbers
of less than 10^6.<br>
3. The impingement of water on the airfoil model in both flight
and in the icing-research tunnel caused a forward movement of transition. 
During the flight-icing conditions, only a very small region of
laminar heat transfer resulted; no fully laminar heat transfer was
obtained in the tunnel-icing investigations. Transition in the icing-research 
tunnel was initiated at local Reynolds numbers of from less
than 3x10^5 to approximately 10^6 with full turbulent heat transfer being
achieved at local Reynolds numbers varying from approximately 8x10^5
to 4x10^6.<br>
4. The type of heating and temperature patterns had measurable
effects on the heat transfer.<br>
5. The calculation of heating requirements based on the icing-research-tunnel 
convective-heat-transfer results will generally result
in conservative values, that is more heat than necessary should be
available to cope with the particular icing situation. The amount by
which the heating requirements are conservative is dependent on the
specific design conditions.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The determination of heat transfer coefficients is necessary for detailed icing thermal analysis. 
However, there are limits to the accuracy of the values calculated or measured. </p>
<p>A heat transfer textbook <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> advises when using heat transfer correlations (for dry air conditions):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foregoing correlations are suitable for most engineering calculations. 
However, they should not be viewed as providing exact determinations of the 
coefficients. Conditions may vary according to the freestream turbulence and 
surface roughness, and <strong>it would be unreasonable to expect the correlations to 
predict results to better than 25% accuracy</strong>. This statement made be made 
for virtually all the correlations to be considered.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA studies that measured heat transfer coefficients only estimated some errors in the process. 
I would estimate the potential errors in measurement to be of the same order of magnitude (+/-25%) 
as that noted for correlations above. </p>
<p>The situation is more complex for icing conditions. 
Water drops flowing through the heated surface boundary layer may disturb the flow. 
Liquid water or ice on the surface provides roughness that is not there in dry conditions. 
Icing wind tunnels have some free stream turbulence, enhanced by the water spray nozzles. 
Current CFD methods are challenged to account for these effects. 
However, Figure 19 above shows heat transfer coefficients approaching the values 
calculated for turbulent flow, so that appears to be an upper limit, 
"except for the large peaks caused by the discontinuity of the heat distribution". </p>
<p>Calculating heat transfer coefficient is still a challenge. 
I recommend that the values not be treated single, "absolute truth" values. 
Calculations can be made with a range of heat transfer assumptions 
to make sensitivity of results quantitatively apparent. </p>
<p>The fraction of the surface wetted aft of the impingement zone is also 
a factor with variations. Some more recent analysis 
such as <a href="/ads-4.html">ADS-4, “Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data”</a> <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> 
use a fixed value (in the range of 0.2 to 0.25) in the runback area, 
while others such as LEWICE <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> calculate local values based on surface tension and flow calculations. 
SAE AIR 1168/4 <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> assumes 0.6 averaged over the heated surface. 
For running wet conditions, 
the assumed value of fraction wetted can have a significant effect on calculated values. </p>
