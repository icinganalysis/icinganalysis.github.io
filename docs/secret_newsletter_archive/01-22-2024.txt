- Latest finds:

"Electronic Aircraft Icing Handbook"
This includes format updates for DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-2 "Chapter III Ice Protection Methods",
as well as files for analyzing water drop spectrum data, and a database of icing references circa 2007.
This is mentioned in "Aircraft Ice Protection" AC 20-73A https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_20-73A.pdf,
but I could not find it on a current FAA website.
You can view the version from 2008 at
