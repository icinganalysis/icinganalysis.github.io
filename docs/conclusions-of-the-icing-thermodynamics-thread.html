<h2>Open questions</h2>
<p>We will look at some data from the post-NACA era to help resolve these questions. </p>
<ol>
<li>Do calculated freezing fractions correspond to observed values? </li>
<li>Are the water drop evaporation estimates in NACA-TN-3024 accurate? </li>
</ol>
<h2>Freezing fractions</h2>
<h3>Rotating cylinders</h3>
<p>We saw in <a href="/naca-tr-1215.html">NACA-TR-1215</a> good correspondence between flight test 
ice mass and calculated ice mass. </p>
<p>It appears that there were two essential elements of an analysis to well match the flight test rotating cylinder freezing rate values:
1. Evaporation and convection occur on the entire surface of the cylinder.<br>
2. A roughness-enhanced heat transfer relationship (nu = 0.024 * re^0.747)  </p>
<p>However, in <a href="/fraser.html">Fraser, D.: Thermodynamic Limitations of Ice Accretion Instruments</a>, 
the correspondence was not as good for icing tunnel test data. 
This is an area for further investigation. </p>
<h3>Use of LEWICE for rotating cylnders</h3>
<p>While LEWICE is a <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19990021235">well validate tool for airfoils</a>, 
as noted in <a href="images/cylinder_thread_wrap_up/SAE presentation Cook.pdf">"NACA Publications on Aircraft Icing Cylinders"</a>, 
the use of LEWICE for rotating cylinders is not recommended. </p>
<p>The results below are probably using LEWICE for a case that it was not intended for. 
I present results anyway to illustrate the the differences. </p>
<p>The NACA-TR-1215 flight cases were run with LEWICE. 
LEWICE was run in two modes. 
One mode started at the clean cylinder diameter, 
and used the automatic time step method determine the number of ice shape iterations. 
This resulted in 6 to 19 steps, depending on the condition and cylinder size. 
The other mode started at the reported average ice cylinder diameter, 
and used a single, 1 second long time step to calculate an ice growth rate for the cylindrical surface. </p>
<p>LEWICE results had fair to poor agreement for the rotating cylinder flight test data. </p>
<p><img alt="NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24a comparison to lewice" src="images/thermodynamics_wrapup/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24a lewice.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24b comparison to lewice" src="images/thermodynamics_wrapup/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24b lewice.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24c comparison to lewice" src="images/thermodynamics_wrapup/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24c lewice.png">  </p>
<p>[Figure 24d is not compared, as the actual flight LWC value is unknown, 
because all of the cylinders of the multicylinder instrument had unknown degree of limited freezing.]</p>
<h3>Non-rotating cylinders</h3>
<p>The theoretical value "freezing fraction" does have some correspondence to measured test values. </p>
<p>I use the term "correspondence" because while quantitative comparisons can be made, 
there are assumptions in both the test values and the analysis values. </p>
<p>Freezing fraction is difficult to measure experimentally. 
To illustrate, an experimental measurement of "freezing fraction" 
is typically made by running an icing case in an icing wind tunnel, 
measuring the leading edge ice thickness, 
and calculating an apparent stagnation line ice mass growth rate based on an assumed ice density.<br>
This is compared to a calculated ice mass growth rate base on all the ice freezing where it impinges, 
which is dependent on the accuracy of the impingement efficiency calculation 
and the measured tunnel airspeed, liquid water content, 
and the measured or assumed drop size distribution. </p>
<p>We have seen analytical ice mass rate calculations several times, including Messinger <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. 
However, the calculated values are dependent again 
on the measured tunnel airspeed, liquid water content, and drop size distribution, 
and an assumed tunnel test section humidity of 100%, 
as well as the calculated impingement efficiency and heat transfer coefficients, 
which we have seen can vary on the order of +/-25% in <a href="/naca-tn-1472.html">NACA-TN-1472</a> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. 
And the analytical values usually are determined for the initial condition of the 
surface without ice, and do not account for changes in the surface as ice accumulates. </p>
<p>Even with the factors noted above, many cases compare surprisingly (to me, at least) well. </p>
<p>There are several sources of ice measurements on non-rotating cylinders. </p>
<p><a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/49937/32257719-MIT.pdf?sequence=2">AEDC-TR-85-30</a> </p>
<p><img alt="AEDC-TR-85-30 Figure 21" src="images/freezing_fractions/AEDC_TR_85_30_Figure21.png">  </p>
<p><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19960012178/downloads/19960012178.pdf">NASA-TM-107141</a> </p>
<p><img alt="NASA-TM-107141 Figure 10" src="images/freezing_fractions/NASA_TM_107141_Figure10.png">  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar0755.pdf">NASA/CR—2008-215302</a>  </p>
<p><img alt="NASA/CR—2008-215302 Figure 3" src="images/freezing_fractions/NASA_CR_2008_215302_fig3.png">  </p>
<p>The ice thickness at the leading edge was measured from the figures. 
From that, an ice growth rate can be calculated: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>measured_ice_growth_rate = ice_thick / time
</code></pre></div>

<p>A rime ice grow rate can be calculated: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>calculated_rime_ice_growth_rate = lwc/G_PER_KG * beta * u / ice_density
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ice density is assumed to be the bulk ice density, 917 kg/m^3. 
A Langmuir "D" drop size distribution was assumed to calculate the beta value. </p>
<p>And an apparent freezing fraction value can be calculated: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>n_apparent = measured_ice_growth_rate / calculated_rime_ice_growth_rate
</code></pre></div>

<p>The heat transfer relationship from NASA-TM-107141 was used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>nu = 1.244 * re^0.4774
</code></pre></div>

<p>The file "messinger.py" was used to calculate the freezing fraction. 
The freezing fraction is evaluated at the initial cylinder diameter (only). 
The is no attempt to calculate changes during the ice growth, 
when the surface shape becomes non-cylindrical and the heat transfer 
and water catch rate may change.</p>
<p>For the AEDC Table 1, the reported and calculated freezing fraction values agree well, 
but the apparent freezing fraction values have scatter compared to the calculated values.  </p>
<p><img alt="AEDC-TR-85-30 Figure 21 comparison" src="images/freezing_fractions/cylinder_freezing_fractions_AEDC_TR_85_30_fig21.png">  </p>
<p>For NASA-TM-107141, apparent freezing fraction values agree well with the calculated values, 
but the reported values do not. 
As the heat transfer relationship used came from NASA-TM-107141, 
it is not clear what the implementation differences of the calculation would be. </p>
<p><img alt="NASA-TM-107141 Figure 10 comparison" src="images/freezing_fractions/cylinder_freezing_fractions_nasa_tm_107141_table1.png">  </p>
<p>For NASA-CR-2008-215302, the values agree fairly well. </p>
<p><img alt="NASA/CR—2008-215302 Figure 3 comparison" src="images/freezing_fractions/cylinder_freezing_fractions_NASA_CR_2008_215302_fig3.png">  </p>
<h3>LEWICE analysis of non-rotating cylinders</h3>
<p>For non-rotating cylinders, the results with LEWICE are mixed. </p>
<p>Unlike rotating cylinders, LEWICE was apparently intended to be used for non-rotating cylinders, 
as there is a cylinder example in the LEWICE manual. </p>
<p>One case had good agreement at the stagnation line, but varying agreement elsewhere:  </p>
<p><img alt="NASA-TM-107141 Figure 12 comparison to LEWICE" src="images/thermodynamics_wrapup/NASA-TM-107141 Figure 12 LEWICE.png">  </p>
<p>Another case did not agree well at the stagnation line, with varying agreement elsewhere.  </p>
<p><img alt="NASA-TM-107141 Figure 9 comparison to LEWICE" src="images/thermodynamics_wrapup/NASA-TM-107141 Figure 9 LEWICE.png">  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mass values were not recorded in NASA-TM-107141,
so we cannot compare the calculated masses to the observed masses. </p>
<p>Industrious readers are encouraged to run more comparisons, 
but these two examples are typical in my experience. </p>
<p>I speculate that analysis methods other than LEWICE will also be challenged for cylinder cases like these. 
Cylinders have complex aerodynamics, with many cases of interest having separated flow. 
As we saw in the <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">Icing on Cylinders thread</a>, 
the water impingement values can be accurately calculated with potential flow, 
which does not include separation, 
but other flow features, such as surface pressure coefficient and 
heat transfer coefficients, may be more sensitive. </p>
<h3>Airfoil leading edge approximated as a cylinder</h3>
<p><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20050215212/downloads/20050215212.pdf">NASA/CR-2005-213852</a>  </p>
<p>This treats the airfoil leading edge as a cylinder with a diameter equal to twice the leading edge radius of curvature. </p>
<p>The freezing fraction values agree well at higher values, 
but at lower values the scatter is greater than the +/-10% region shown. </p>
<p><img alt="NASA/CR-2005-213852 Figure 3" src="images/freezing_fractions/NASA_CR_2005_213852_Figure3.png">  </p>
<p>I view this as validation of Uwe von Glahn's assertion that 
<strong>"The collection of ice by the cylinders is similar to the collection of ice by airplane components"</strong> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> from 1955,
but it took 50 years to get the measured data. </p>
<h3>"Ludam Limits"</h3>
<p>Related to the freezing fraction calculation is the "Ludlam Limit", 
the maximum water catch rate where all available water is frozen. 
It is often expressed as a "critical" LWC value. </p>
<p>However, as we saw in the reviews of <a href="/ludlam.html">Ludlam</a> 
and <a href="/naca-tr-1215-thermodynamics.html">NACA-TR-1215</a>, 
there are several different "Ludlam Limit" methods that yield different values. </p>
<p>The values are so disparate that the term Ludlam limit has almost lost meaning. </p>
<p><img alt="Comparison of &quot;Ludlam limit&quot; values" src="images/Ludlam/ludlam_comparisons_all.png"> </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 24c calculated Ludlam limits" src="images/naca-tr-1215/NACA-TR-1215 Figure 24c_critical_plus.png">  </p>
<p>If you need to calculate if all available water is freezing on a surface, 
be sure that you have validation data for the method applicable to your environment 
(natural icing, icing wind tunnel) and configuration (rotating cylinder, cylinder, airfoil, other),
or you may well find large differences between test and analysis values.  </p>
<p>Also note that for natural icing conditions, NACA-TR-1215 presents a critical value, 
that can be predicted, and run-off values, that can only be determined post-test 
by comparing the various multicylinder values. </p>
<h2>Water drop evaporation</h2>
<p>I will defer the evaluation of this to a future post in the <a href="/water-drop-evaporation.html">"Water Drop Evaporation thread"</a>. 
We will put together several pieces from the NACA-era to implement this, 
similar to <a href="/naca-tn-3024.html">NACA-TN-3024</a>, 
but without the equilibrium assumption.<br>
We require post-NACA era data to validate the model. 
Once we have a water drop motion simulation, 
we can can get the differential airspeed values 
needed to calculate the water drop heat and mass transfer. </p>
<p>For now, I will say that <a href="/naca-tn-3024.html">NACA-TN-3024</a> 
is correct in the conclusion that less than 1% of the water mass evaporates, 
but the details of how one gets there are different. </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<h3>Influential authors</h3>
<p>There was a notable shift in influence from the NACA-era to the post-NACA era. </p>
<p>J. K. Hardy's publications were highly influential in the NACA-era. 
He either authored or is cited by 10 of the 14 publications in the Thermodynamics thread. 
However, Hardy is not often cited in recent publications. 
Not being included from the references of ADS-4 (where Hardy's datum temperature was described but not credited) 
may have had an influence on that. </p>
<p>The validation of Hardy's equations to the limits of the test methods available at the time in 
<a href="/naca-tn-3024.html">NACA-TN-3024</a> 
(runback ice testing is challenging, especially at Mach 1.35) 
is a "lost gem" (rarely cited) and a
crowning achievement of the NACA-era, in my view. </p>
<p>Messinger's publication <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is highly influential in the post-NACA era, 
and is still cited frequently in recent literature, 
but was cited only once in the NACA publications. 
Messinger cited three of Hardy's publications 
and acknowledged Hardy's contributions in the text. 
Perhaps we may view Hardy as still having influence, 
but one layer down in the citations. </p>
<p>One thing that is common to the NACA-era and the post-NACA era 
is the influence of Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. 
Six of the 14 publications in the Thermodynamics thread cite Langmuir and Blodgett. 
Recent publications frequently cite Langmuir and Blodgett. </p>
<h3>Data still used today</h3>
<p>Messinger's model and "extended" Messinger models are used extensively today for icing analysis. 
The recent publications citing Messinger are too numerous to list here, 
see an automatically updated listing at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2021&amp;q=Equilibrium+Temperature+of+an+Unheated+Icing+Surface+as+a+Function+of+Airspeed&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,48">scholar.google.com</a>
(115 results since 2021, sampled on May 15, 2022, it may well grow by the time this post is published). 
The original publication lacked features such as surface pressure variations that
some extended models add. </p>
<p>Note that there are many details in implementing the Messinger model, 
and different implementations may yield different results 
(see the discussion of NASA-TM-107141 above). </p>
<p>The single control volume anti-ice calculation method from <a href="/ads-4.html">ADS-4</a> is still in use today,
or at least it has not been deprecated in later design guides such as <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. 
However, the wide availability of LEWICE and other 2D and 3D ice protection 
design tools has largely displaced its use. </p>
