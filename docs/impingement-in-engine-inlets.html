<p>SUMMARY<br>
The path of cloud droplets into two engine inlets have been
calculated for a wide range of meteorological and flight conditions.
The amount of water in droplet form ingested by the inlets and
the amount and distribution of water impinging on the inlet
walls are obtained from the droplet-trajectory calculation .
In both types of inlet, a prolate ellipsoid of revolution represents
either part or all of the forebody at the center of an annuLar
inlet to an engine. The configurations can also represent a
fuselage of an airplane with side-scoop inlets. The studies
were made at an angle of attack of 0°. The principal difference
between the two inlets studied is that the inlet-air velocity of one
is 0.7 that of the other. The studies of the two velocity ratio
lead to some important general concept of water ingestion in
inlets.  </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br>
A part of a comprehensive program on cloud-droplet-trajectory 
computation, the NACA Lewis laboratory has
calculated the paths of droplet ahead of and surrounding
prolate ellipsoids of revolution moving through clouds
(ref. 1 to 4). The present report extends the trajectory
computation with respect to prolate ellipsoids in an incompressible 
flow field to include the study of water ingestion
into two engine inlets a  0° angle of attack. In both inlets, an
ellipsoid represents either part or all of the forebody at the
center of an annular inlet to an engine, or some other air-processing device. 
In either inlet, the ellipsoid can also
be assumed to approximate the fuselage of an airplane so
that the inlets become side ram-scoop inlets.
The configurations, which are described in detail in the
following section, are geometrically simple in order to permit
the studies described herein. In spite of the simplicity,
the configurations are reasonable approximation of those
found on aircraft. The results of the studies on the two
simple shapes lead to important general concepts of water
ingestion in to inlets of this type.</p>
<p>The ellipsoids chosen for this study are 10 and 20 percent
thick (fineness ratio of 10 and 5, respectively) for configuration 1 (fig. l (a)) and 10 percent thick for configuration 2
(fig. 1 (b)) . The problem is limited to an angle of attack
of 0° between the major axis of the ellipsoid and the free-stream 
air, because the facile methods of calculating the
flow field and trajectories are limited to 0°.</p>

<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
  The data presented herein can be used as a guide in the evaluation of water ingestion in inlets. The studies on the simple shapes at 0 angle of attack lead to some general concepts of water ingestion in inlets. The amount of water ingested is not sensitive to small changes in shape of the outer wall. The placement of a wall in the airflow will usually disturb the airflow more than the droplet trajectories. The impingement on the cowl (i.e. , amount and distribution) is quite sensitive to the physical shape and surface condition of the wall. In most applications impingement on the interior surface of the cowl can be expected for a considerable distance inside the entrance, because the forebody deviates the trajectories away from the body and toward the cowl.<br>
  The use of screens and boundary-layer-removal scoops at the entrance requires careful design because of the existence of the shadow zone and regions of high concentration. The variation in concentration of water across an inlet shows that a screen can build up ice unevenly in such manner as to result in large radial-flow distortions.<br>
  Although only one inlet configuration was studied at an inlet velocity ratio of 0.7, the general concept that lowering the inlet velocity ratio lowers the ingestion efficiency can be applied to a large variety of configurations. This concept is evident from a study of the manner in which air streamlines change when the inlet-air velocity ratio is decreased for a particular configuration. Since most aircraft (particularly interceptor types) should be designed with protection against ice formations during loitering, climb, and letdown, a design based on water-ingestion data for an inlet velocity ratio of 1.0 will be adequate for lower velocity ratios. A lowering of the velocity ratio will also result in higher impingement near the inlet opening on the inner surface of the cowl.<br>
  As can be seen from figures 5 and 19, no impingement occurs on the outer surface of the cowl over a large range of meteorological and flight conditions. High local impingement efficiencies can be expected on the cowl lip for all entrance velocity ratios.<br>
  During the major portion of most flight plans the inlet velocity ratio does not exceed 1.0 and does not decrease below 0.7. For most inlet designs, the accuracy of the methods presented herein for estimating amount and distribution of impingement is within the accuracy of knowledge of the meteorological factors involved, such as liquid-water content and droplet size.<br>
  As was stated early in this report, droplets that impinge on the forebody are assumed to be removed from the possibility of entering the inlets. In reality, the water deposited on the forebody may run back over the body surface and into the inlet when the ice is melted by thermal anti-icing devices. A discussion of runback is beyond the scope of this report. The conditions resulting in runback and the effect of runback on screens, boundary-layer scoops, and other devices in the inlets should be carefully considered in inlet designs.<br>
  Although the calculations were made for incompressible flow, they should be applicable throughout the subsonic region because of the small effect of compressibility on droplet trajectories (ref. 5) and the high flight critical Mach number of the configurations studied.  </p>

<h3>Impingment tests, NACA-TN-4268</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
The amount of water in cloud droplet form ingested by a full-scale
supersonic nose inlet with conical centerbody was measured in the NACA
Lewis icing tunnel. Local and total water impingement rates on the cowl
and centerbody surfaces were also obtained. All measurements were made
with a dye-tracer technique. The range of operating and meteorological
conditions studied was: angles of attack of 0 and 4.2, volume-median
droplet diameters from about 11 to 20 microns, and ratios of inlet to
free-stream velocity from about 0.4 to 1.8. Although the inlet was designed 
for supersonic (Mach 2.0) operation of the aircraft, the tunnel
measurements were confined to a free-stream velocity of 156 knots (Mach
0.237). The data are extendable to other subsonic speeds and droplet
sizes by dimensionless impingement parameters.<br>
Impingement and ingestion efficiencies are functions of the ratio
of inlet to free-stream velocity as well as droplet size. For the model
and range of conditions studied, progressively increasing the inlet velocity 
ratio from less than to greater than 1.0 increased the centerbody
impingement efficiency and shifted the cowl impingement region from the
inner- to outer-cowl surfaces, respectively. The ratio of water ingested
by the inlet plane to that contained in a free-stream tube of cross-section 
equal to that at the inlet plane also increased with increasing
inlet velocity ratio. Theoretically calculated values of inlet water
(or droplet) ingestion are in good agreement with experiment for annular
inlet configurations.  </p>
<p>These data were obtained in the NACA Lewis
icing tunnel by using the dye-tracer technique.</p>

<p>There was a comparison of results to those in NACA-TR-1317. 
One might call them, at best, approximately similar configurations.  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 8. Schematic geometric comparison of experimental inlet configuration with theoretical studied configurations." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-4268%2FFigure%208.png">  </p>
<p>However, at least for the comparison of concentration factor (Ct) values, the results are similar. 
(The theoretical values may be difficult to discern in amongst the test results.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the value of Ct for fully annular inlets of this type
appears relatively insensitive to changes in the inlet configuration as
indicated by figures 7 and 8, local impingement rates or limits of 
impingement on the inlet surfaces, or both, probably will be significantly
different for small changes in the inlet configuration.</p>
<p>Generalization of Impingement and Ingestion Characteristics<br>
In the literature, local and total collection efficiencies and impingement 
limit are usually presented as functions of K and φ. The
parameter K indicates the inertia of the droplet, and φ represents
the deviation of the droplet drag forces from Stokes' law. As discussed
and illustrated in references 26 and 22, Smax, β, and Em
can be correlated with reasonable accuracy with one independent parameter - 
the modified inertia parameter; likewise, the amount of water ingested should be
amenable to this treatment. The modified inertia parameter
Ko (Ko = λ/λs K; λ/λs = f(Reo), see ref. 22) accounts for the pertinent
impingement variables of droplet size, body size, airspeed, and altitude.
Use of the Ko parameter yields a set of points for any dependent impingement factor 
(Smax, β, or Em) that can be essentially represented by
a single curve, independent of φ; this curve is approximately the solution 
using Stokes' law for sphere (droplet) drag. From experience with
the Ko parameter, limited experimental or theoretical impingement and
ingestion data can be reasonably extended or interpolated over a wide
range of variables although no complete substantiation of its significance
or validity is currently available.<br>
With a cloud composed of nonuniform droplet sizes, impingement and
ingestion efficiencies are correlated with Ko,med (Ko calculated with
d_med). Because the limit of impingement is a function of the maximum
droplet diameter present in the cloud, Smax will be correlated with
Ko,max (Ko calculated with d_max).  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Concluding Remarks<br>
Reference 24 implies that the unknown impingement of a body may be
approximately equal to the known impingement of a reference body provided
the local surface pressure (or velocity) distributions of the reference
body can be made approximately equal to those of the unknown body by
varying angle of attack or chord length or both. In particular, the pressure 
distributions and surface contours need be similar in the impingement
regions of both bodies. Extending this reasoning to an annular inlet such
as the type studied herein suggests the possibility of estimating cowl
and centerbody impingement from the known impingement of several airfoils
(refs. 11 to 18 and 22) and bodies of revolution (refs. 7, 8, 23, and 27).
Demonstration or proof of the validity of such an analysis is beyond the
scope of this report.<br>
Most of the reported data on droplet size and liquid-water content
of natural icing clouds has been obtained with the rotating multicylinder
method (ref. 2). Such values are readily converted to the slightly different 
ones quoted herein for the tunnel cloud (by Joukowski-aspirator
method) by figure 19 of reference 22. A sample calculation applying
tunnel impingement data to flight conditions is given in reference 22.</p>

<p>Reference 22 is NACA-TN-3839, which we will see in the upcoming "Impingement on Airfoils".</p>
<p>At a company I worked at we had an internal design manual that cataloged dozens 
of impingement analysis for several inlets. The results were similar to Figure 4 above, 
all with the same general trends, but there were differences in the details. </p>
