<h1>"Total Pressure Distortion and Recovery of Supersonic Nose Inlet with Conical Centerbody in Subsonic Icing Conditions" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice was formed on a full-scale unheated supersonic nose inlet in the
NACA Lewis icing tunnel to determine its effect on compressor-face total-pressure 
distortion and recovery. Inlet angle of attack was varied from
0° to 12°, free-stream Mach number from 0.17 to 0.28, and compressor-face
Mach number from 0.10 to 0.47. Icing-cloud liquid-water content was
varied from 0.65 to 1.8 grams per cubic meter at free-stream static air
temperatures of 15° and 0° F.  </p>
<p>The addition of ice to the inlet components increased total-pressure-
distortion levels and decreased recovery values compared with clear-air
results, the losses increasing with time in ice. The combination of
glaze ice, high corrected weight flow, and high angle of attack yielded
the highest levels of distortion and lowest values of recovery. The
general character of compressor-face distortion with an iced inlet was
the same as that for the clean inlet, the total-pressure gradients being
predominantly radial, with circumferential gradients occurring at angle
of attack.  </p>
<p>At zero angle of attack, free-stream Mach number of 0.27, and a
constant corrected weight flow of 150 pounds per second (compressor-face
Mach number of 0.43), compressor-face total-pressure-distortion level
increased from about 6 percent in clear air to 12 percent after 21
minutes of heavy glaze icing; concurrently, total-pressure recovery decreased 
from about 0.98 to 0.945. For the same operating conditions but
with the inlet at 12° angle of attack, a change in distortion level
occurred from about 9 percent in clear air to 14 percent after 2 minutes
of icing, with a decrease in recovery from about 0.97 to 0.94.</p>

<p>APPARATUS  </p>
<p>Model and Installation  </p>
<p>A front view of the supersonic-nose-inlet model installed in the
6- by 9-foot test section of the Lewis icing tunnel is shown in figure 1.
The over-all length of the installation was about 20 feet, with a main
support pedestal located near the midpoint. Additional support was provided 
by an A-frame just aft of the inlet lips. A prototype (full-scale)
inlet was used for the first few feet of the external cowling and the
first 7 feet within the inlet model (forward of the compressor-face
station). The aft 13 feet of the installation contained the ejector
nozzles and ducting used to simulate the pumping action of an engine
compressor.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%201.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conical centerbody was supported by three equally spaced swept-back 
struts mounted from the outer shell or cowling, as indicated by the
schematic drawing of the inlet and afterbody in figure 2(a). The over-all
top view of figure 2(a) shows the inlet at 12° angle of attack. Because
of the model and tunnel size, only the forward half of the installation
was at angle of attack relative to the free stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%202.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The front-view schematic drawing of the inlet shown in figure 2(a)
indicates the positions of the three centerbody struts and the sub-inlet
as mounted in the tunnel. This sub-inlet, which provides air for oil-cooling, 
is one of three included in the prototype design. A side view
of the sub-inlet (located between stations 35 and 104) is also shown.
Airflow through the sub-inlet is independently controlled by two ejector
nozzles (one shown) and a butterfly valve. A front-view photograph of
the inlet model showing the support struts and sub-inlet is given in
figure 2(b).  </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 2b.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%202b.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 2(c) presents the annular flow areas within the main inlet
from the cowl-lip station 1.9 to the compressor-face station 85. These
flow areas at any nacelle station, which are calculated on the assumption
that the airflow across the annulus is parallel to the mean radius at that
station, account for the presence of the centerbody support struts.
Significant airflow areas are: inlet lips (station 1.9), 4.576 square
feet; inlet throat (station 20), 3.40 square feet; and compressor face
(station 85), 4.549 square feet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As shown in figure 3, model instrumentation consisted of 16 rake's
(electrically heated coaxial pressuretubes) and 16 flush wall static
taps, eight on the centerbody and eight on the cowl inner wall. All model
instrumentation was at the simulated compressor face (station 85); a
photograph looking upstream at this station is shown in figure 3(a).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF DATA  </p>
<p>The effect of mode of operation in evaluating compressor-face airflow
distortion and pressure recovery resulting from iced inlet components is
illustrated in figure 4. This figure is a schematic representation of
typical total-pressure distortion and recovery data as a function of
corrected weight flow. The dashed curves for zero icing time (clear air)
indicate the usual trends of distortion increases and recovery decreases
with increased corrected weight flow (refs 5 and 7). Similar but more
pronounced trends are noted for the dashed curves for 5 minutes in icing
(fixed free-stream icing condition). The solid lines connecting the
symbols (number beside each data symbol denotes minutes of icing at a
fixed free-stream condition) represent data obtained from a typical
tunnel mode of operation. For the tunnel mode, corrected weight flow
decreases with icing time; concurrently, distortion and recovery continue
to increase and decrease, respectively. Generally, a change in the
free-stream icing condition will shift the curves of constant icing time
for all icing times greater than 0. Also indicated in figure 4 is the
inlet-throat (station 20, fig. 2(c)) choking limit (assuming no losses).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 4.png" src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E57G09%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With an engine operating at a constant corrected engine speed, the
curve for engine mode of operation would be vertical at a particular
constant value of corrected weight flow (dotted line, fig. 4). The shaded
areas in figure 4 emphasize the range of divergence between the tunnel
mode of operation (solid line) and the engine mode of operation (dotted
vertical line). Changes in distortion and pressure recovery with icing
time are increased by the engine mode of operation as compared with the
tunnel mode. By presenting data for total-pressure distortion and
recovery in the form of figure 4, interpretation of results is not
completely restricted to the tunnel mode of operation, and a reasonable
approximation of losses at constant corrected weight flow (engine mode of
operation) is possible.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   </p>
<p>Total-pressure distortion and recovery as functions of corrected
weight flow are presented in figure 5 for all conditions studied herein.
Figures 5(a) to (d) depict four different free-stream icing conditions
with the inlet model at zero angle of attack. For a particular icing
condition, the effects of angle of attack are illustrated in figures 5(e),
(g), arid (h), for angles of 12°, 8°, and 4°, respectively. For 12° angle
of attack, figure 5(f) presents data for a less severe icing condition
than that shown in figure 5(e). The effects of corrected weight flow,
free-stream icing condition, icing time, angle of attack, and mode of
operation are obtained from a study of the data in figure 5. These effects
are isolated and presented separately in the following discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Icing Results  </p>
<p>The glaze-ice formations of run 1 are considerably larger than the
rime-ice formations of run 4 and cause more disturbances to the inlet
airflow, as reflected in the tabulated values of distortion and recovery
and in the corresponding total-pressure-contour maps. Except for the
local flow disturbances caused by the 3 o'clock support strut and the
sub-inlet between the 4 and 5 o'clock positions previously discussed, the
total-pressure contours are generally symmetrical, with radial gradients
or distortion. At zero icing time the pressure gradients are most severe
near the cowl wall. With time in icing the gradients increase near the
cowl and centerbody and extend farther into the flow annulus, thereby
reducing the area of high pressure recovery. The photographs and pressure-contour 
maps for glaze-icing run 1 in figure 9(a) are typical of those
obtained for the other glaze-icing runs 2 and 6 (figs. 5(a) and (c),
respectively). Likewise, figure 9(b) for run 4 is typical for the other
rime-icing runs 5 and 7 (figs. 5(b) and (d), respectively).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of a glaze and a rime cowl-lip ice formation at nearly
the same inlet velocity ratio is illustrated by figures 11(a) and (c).
The smoother rime formation of figure 11(c) results in distortion and
pressure-recovery values of [15 percent] and [0.945], respectively, an
improvement over the comparable glaze formation values of [20 percent]
and [0.915]. Compressor-face distortion and recovery for the rime ice
formation (fig. 11(c)) are also an improvement over those obtained at
the higher inlet velocity ratio with glaze ice (fig. 11(b)). The
distortion and pressure-recovery values also include the effects of ice
formations on the centerbody and support struts, while only cowl-lip ice
is illustrated by the sketches. However, the contour plots of figure 9
indicate that cowl-lip disturbances are the more controlling factor.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Concluding Remarks  </p>
<p>Compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery are closely
related to the particular design and operation of an inlet in clear air
or in icing, and the type and location of inlet ice are important factors.
Under certain icing and operating conditions the data herein indicate that
ice formations on an engine inlet cause increased distortions that may
result in significant thrust reductions and surge or stall problems, based
on previous data. These penalties to engine performance may be approximated 
from the data presented herein for an engine with known distortion
tolerance.  </p>
<p>Although there was little breakoff of ice from the inlet components
during these studies, the danger of ice breakoff and ingestion by the
engine exists and should be considered with reference to elimination of
an inlet icing-protection system. Thus, the possible penalties regarding
engine performance and engine damage accruing from inlet icing are such
as to favor icing protection for the inlet unless the particular configuration 
or flight plan reduces the risks of no protection to an acceptable
level.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>The effects on compressor-face total-pressure distortion and recovery
of ice formations on the unheated supersonic nose inlet studied are
summarized as follows: <br>
1. The addition of ice to the inlet components resulted in increased
distortion levels and reduced pressure recovery compared with clear-air
values, the losses increasing with time in icing.<br>
2. The compressor-face flow losses were greatest for the higher
corrected weight flows and angles of attack and for glaze-ice formations.
After a few minutes of glaze icing the effects of angle of attack on
distortion level and recovery are minimized.<br>
3. The general character of compressor-face distortion with an iced
inlet was the same as that for the clean inlet except for steeper pressure
gradients (distortion patterns). The pressure gradients with the inlet
studied were predominantly radial, with circumferential gradients occurring
at angle of attack.<br>
4. From a constant-corrected-weight-flow (150 lb/sec, compressor-face 
Mach number of 0.43) interpretation of the tunnel data, total-pressure 
distortion increased from about 6 percent in clear air to 12
percent after 2 minutes of heavy glaze icing. Concurrently, total-pressure 
recovery decreased from about 0.98 to 0.945. These results are
for the inlet studied at 0° angle of attack, a free-stream Mach number
of 0.27, a liquid-water content of 1.3 grams per cubic meter, a droplet
diameter of 16 microns, and a free-stream static air temperature of 15° F. <br>
For comparable operating conditions but with the inlet at 12° angle
of attack, a change in distortion level occurred from about 9 percent in
clear air to 14 percent after 2 minutes of icing, with a decrease in
pressure recovery from about 0.97 to 0.94.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more recent turbofan designs, 
the engine itself may have few components heated for ice protection, 
but the engine inlet leading edges ("lips") generally do have ice protection.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigations have been made in flight and in wind tunnels tc
determine which components of turbojet installations are most critical
in icing conditions, and to evaluate several methods of icing protection. 
From these studies, the requirements necessary for adequate
icing protection and the consequent penalties on engine performance
can be estimated.  </p>
<p>Because investigations have indicated that the compressor-inlet
screen constitutes the greatest icing hazard and is difficult to protect, 
complete removal or retraction of the screen upon encountering
an icing condition is recommended. In the absence of the screen, the
inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine constitute the
greatest danger to engine operation in an icing condition; a centrifugal-
type engine, on the other hand, is relatively unsusceptible to icing

<p>An investigation was conducted to determine the electric power
requirements necessary for ice protection of inlet guide vanes by continuous 
heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show
the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air
velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements
for these two methods of ice protection.<br>
The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 inlet
guide vanes under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide 
a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A photographic technique for investigating water droplets of diameter 
less than 200 microns falling freely in air at temperatures between
0° C and -50° C has been devised and used to determine:<br>
(1) The shape of frozen droplets<br>
(2) The occurrence of collisions of partly frozen or of frozen and
liquid droplets<br>
(3) The statistics on the freezing temperatures of individual
free-falling droplets  </p>
<p>A considerable number of droplets were found to have a non-spherical
shape after freezing because of various protuberances and frost growth,
and droplet aggregates formed by collision. The observed frequency of
collision of partly frozen droplets showed good order of magnitude agreement 
with the …</p></blockquote>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A Bragg X-ray spectrometer equipped with a volume-sensitive Geiger 
counter and Soller slits and employing filtered molybdenum Kα, radiation 
was used to obtain a set of diffracted intensity curves as a function 
of angle for supercooled water. Diffracted intensity curves in 
the temperature region of 21° to -16° C were obtained. The minimum
between the two main diffraction peaks deepened continuously with 
lowering temperature, indicating a gradual change in the internal 
structure of the water. No discontinuity in this trend was noted at 
the melting point. The internal structure of supercooled water was
concluded to become progressively more ice-like as the temperature 
is lowered.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Measurements of propeller efficiency loss due to ice formation are
supplemented by an analysis to establish the magnitude of efficiency
losses to be anticipated during flight in icing conditions. The measurements 
were made during flight in natural icing conditions; whereas the
analysis consisted of an investIgation of changes in blade-section 
aerodynamic characteristics caused by ice formation and the resulting 
propeller efficiency changes. Agreement in the order of magnitude of 
efficiency losses tobe expected is obtained between measured and analytical
results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can
be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which
will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There was limited data for properties of liquid water below the temperature of 0° C (supercooled water) at the start of the NACA-era. 
The five studies reviewed here sought to improve the data available.  </p>
<p>The authors were well-informed of other studies available at the time. 
New instruments were conceived and built for these studies. </p>
<p>These five studies largely considered water drops, 
although much of the data are also applicable to more general aircraft icing analysis.  </p>
<p>Four of the studies concern the temperature at which supercooled water drops will 
spontaneously freeze (freeze without outside influence other than temperature).  </p>
<p>Several of the studies note similarities of the properties …</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Icing threats to airships are assessed.  </p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A series of test flights was conducted by the U. S. Navy over a 3-year 
period to evaluate the effects of icing on the operation of the
ZPG-2 airship. In supercooled. clouds, ice formed only on the forward
edges of small protuberances and wires and presented no serious hazard
to operation. Ice accretions of the glaze type which occurred in conditions 
described as freezing drizzle adversely affected various components
to a somewhat greater extent. The results indicated, a need for protection 
of certain components such as antennas, propellers, and certain
parts of the control system.  </p>
<p>The tests showed that icing of the large …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in 
<a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a> 
in the "Meteorology of Icing Clouds" section. </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<!--
Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in 
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md) 
in the "Meteorology of Icing Clouds" section. 
While the publications are important and useful, 
they did not directly affect the icing design values adopted in regulations. 
-->
<p>The first several publications are only briefly described, 
as their major results are incorporated into the final publication, 
NASA Memo 1-19-59E, which will be reviewed at length. </p>
<p>Note that NACA-RM-E52J06 outlines the need for data from broader sources, that is a theme in these publications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The majority of the research flights into icing conditions were
made by attempting to select weather conditions, flight paths, and altitudes, 
which would yield heavy or continuous icing. Multiple traverses
were often made when such conditions were found. It is impossible,
therefore, to determine from this information the extent or frequency
of specified icing …</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>NACA publications contributed heavily to the creation of the Appendix C icing regulation.  </li>
<li>The key flight tests and publications were complete by 1952.  </li>
<li>Some engineering judgement went into creating the icing regulation.  </li>
<li>There was remarkable progress in the three-year span 1946 through 1949.  </li>
<li>The data from 1949 compares well to more recent flight test measurements.  </li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>"Protuberances" on an airfoil can have significant effects on section lift and drag. </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The drag and interference caused by protuberance
from the surface of an airfoil have been determined in the
N.A.C.A. Variable-Density Wind Tunnel at a Reynolds
Number of approximately 3,100,000. The effects of variations
of the fore-and-aft position, height, and shape of
the protuberance were measured by determining how the
airfoil section characteristics were affected by the addition
of th various protuberances extending along the entire 
span of the airfoil. The results provide …</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>An experimental investigation was conducted in a 3.84- by 10-inch

of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 and pressure altitudes to 30,000 feet. Measurements

design of cyclic thermal deicing systems that are attractive for
small high-speed aircraft for which thermal anti-icing requirements 
have become severe.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cylinder has a wide range of current uses in aviation:<br>
- Meteorological instruments for flight and icing wind tunnel tests<br>
- Aircraft in-flight ice detectors and indicators<br>
- Structural elements (such as landing gear and cables)<br>
- An approximation of an airfoil leading edge (used in thermal design and icing wind tunnel test conditions determination <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>)   </p>
<p>Icing conditions measurements with instruments based on cylinders were key to developing the 
current aircraft flight in icing certification regulations.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-two NACA publications related to aircraft icing were 
identified in <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">"The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications"</a>, 
and categorized into 17 topics.</p>

<p>Many new aircraft icing problems aren’t new at all. 
Like excavating a lost city, many surprises, answers to problems, 
road maps, and confirmations can be found in the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). 
This treasure trove of data can help you today. </p>
<p>Why care about aircraft icing?  If ice forms on a plane during flight, it can be hazardous. 
Engineers research the weather conditions aircraft will encounter and work to ensure that 
they can navigate them safely. </p>
