<h1>NACA-TN-4220, A Flight Evaluation and Analysis of the Effect of Icing Conditions on the PG-2 Airship</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Icing threats to airships are assessed.  </p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A series of test flights was conducted by the U. S. Navy over a 3-year 
period to evaluate the effects of icing on the operation of the
ZPG-2 airship. In supercooled. clouds, ice formed only on the forward
edges of small protuberances and wires and presented no serious hazard
to operation. Ice accretions of the glaze type which occurred in conditions 
described as freezing drizzle adversely affected various components
to a somewhat greater extent. The results indicated, a need for protection 
of certain components such as antennas, propellers, and certain
parts of the control system.  </p>
<p>The tests showed that icing of the large surface of the envelope
occurred only in freezing rain or drizzle. Because of the infrequent
occurrence of these conditions, the potential maximum severity could not
be estimated from the test results. The increases in heaviness caused
by icing in freezing rain and drizzle were substantial, but well within
the operational capabilities of the airship.  </p>
<p>In order to estimate the potential operational significance of icing
in freezing rain, theoretical calculations were used to estimate: (1)
the rate of icing as a function of temperature and rainfall intensity,
(2) the climatological probability of occurrence of various combinations
of these variables, and (3) the significance of the warming influence of
the ocean in alleviating freezing-rain conditions. The results of these
calculations suggest that, although very heavy icing rates are possible
in combinations of low temperature and high rainfall rate, the occurrence
of such conditions is very infrequent in coastal areas and virtually impossible 
200 or 300 miles offshore.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>One of my mentors once told me (with a rich Texas drawl), "A blimp don't gather no ice". 
Well, true enough for typical cloud drop sizes (10 to 50 micrometer in diameter), 
but freezing rain and snow are threats to airships.</p>
<p>As we saw in the review <a href="/bodies-of-revolution.html">Bodies of Revolution</a>, 
very large bodies can have zero impingement of small drops. 
This is the case for an airship moving through a typical cloud. </p>
<p>As we saw in the review <a href="/component-icing.html">Component Ice Protection</a>, 
the smaller components (propellers, instruments, etc.) may require ice protection.  </p>
<p>Here we will see flight tests results. 
There are also rather detailed appendices analyzing the of threat of freezing rain that are not detailed herein. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>The nonrigid airship ("blimp") has been adapted to carry aircraft
detection equipment for use in the air defense system. The aircraft-early-warning 
mission requires that picket aircraft endure all types of
weather conditions while maintaining a continuous watch from a particular
area. In support of this mission a project was established by the Office
of Naval Research to evaluate the all-weather capabilities of the ZPG-2
airship (975,000 cu ft envelope)(fig. 1). The flight testing was assigned
to the Naval Air Development unit at the United States Naval Air Station
in South Weymouth, Massachusetts. The NACA Lewis laboratory was requested
by the Office of Naval Research to assist the Navy by supplying instrumentation 
and technical assistance in analyzing and studying the icing
problem as applied to airships.  </p>
<p>Weather conditions considered hazardous to airborne operations are
those conducive to ice and snow accumulations on various parts of the
airship and those affecting the operational capability of the airship,
such as winds and turbulence. The flight tests and study reported herein
were conducted only for the purpose of investigating the airworthiness of
the airship in various types of icing conditions.  </p>
<p>Flights in Rime Ice  </p>
<p>The rime icing conditions were found in typical supercooled clouds
with temperatures ranging from -2 to -10 C and liquid-water contents
from 0.1 to 0.5 gram per cubic meter. The ice formations were different
from those produced in freezing drizzle in that the rime accretions were
confined to the forward edges of small objects only and, unlike glaze-ice 
formations, had less tendency to spread. A comparison of the two
types of ice formation is shown in the flight photographs of figure 3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flights in Snow  </p>
<p>Several flights were conducted in moderate to heavy snow with little
or no in-flight effects on the airship. Snow loads accumulated while an
airship is on the mast have long been recognized as a serious problem.
In flight, however, most of the snow catch blows off at the higher air-speeds, 
except possibly very wet snow. The results of a 2-hour flight
in light to moderate snow at -2 to -6 C are shown in figure 5(a). A
small catch estimated to be about 1000 pounds can be seen distributed
along the top of the envelope and in the catenary seam along the side.
On other flights snow was observed only on the top, between and aft of
the fin area, as shown in figure 5(b).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS  </p>
<p>In test flights conducted by the Navy to evaluate the effects of ice
accretions on the ZPG-2 airship a number of typical icing conditions were
encountered. While the airship was exposed to these conditions, ice
formed on various components but presented no serious hazard to the operation 
of the airship, although some potentially unsafe situations developed. 
The more common rime ice formed only on the forward edges of
small protuberances and wires without causing appreciable concern. Ice
accretions of the glaze type which occurred in what was described as
freezing drizzle adversely affected various components to a somewhat
greater extent. Protective designs for some of the affected components
appeared desirable to assure safe operations.  </p>
<p>A study of the ice accretion problem for airships indicated that
in addition to component icing a problem could develop from an excessive
ice load on the large surface area along the top of the envelope which
would occur only in conditions of freezing rain. This potentially hazardous 
situation was not adequately investigated in the flight tests because 
of the infrequent occurrence of these conditions. However, the
tests verified that ice can form. on the top of the envelope when the
drop sizes approach those characteristic of freezing rain. During these
flights the ice formations did not produce a sufficient increase in airship 
heaviness to become an operational problem.  </p>
<p>The calculations presented in this report show that very heavy ice
loads can be collected under more extreme conditions of rain intensity
and temperature than those encountered during the flight program. The
operational significance of these hazardous conditions depends on the
frequency of their occurrence. In a search for all types of inclement
weather the flight test program demonstrated the low probability of these
situations occurring over land areas along the northeastern coast of the
United States. The probability is further evaluated in this report using
several years of meteorological data from land areas.  </p>
<p>The calculated icing probability curves and the calculated effect
of warming over the sea are somewhat speculative. Actual numerical values 
are therefore uncertain, but the following qualitative conclusions
of operational significance may be stated with considerable confidence:<br>
(1) It is possible to encounter very heavy rates of icing under
conditions of high rainfall rate and low temperature.<br>
(2) Statistics on rainfall rate and temperature in freezing rain
indicate that combinations giving rise to hazardous icing rates may be
expected in from 1 to 5 percent of freezing-rain occurrences over land
areas in the northeastern United States. Since freezing rain occurs in
this area in only about three to five storms per year, the probability
of severe icing is very small.<br>
(3) Because of the warming effect of the sea surface, the probability
of encountering hazardous Icing in freezing rain decreases rapidly with
distance offshore, becoming negligible at 200 to 300 miles.<br>
(4) The effect of freezing rain in aircraft-early-warning operations
is likely to be confined to arrivals and departures, when the airship is
over land or a short distance offshore. Hazardous icing during these
phases of operation can probably be avoided with the aid of weather forecasts, 
since the synoptic conditions required for freezing rain can be
forecast satisfactorily for short periods.  </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Early <a href="/ice-protection.html">Ice Protection Systems</a> were designed without detailed 
knowledge of icing conditions in clouds. 
While successful designs were accomplished with extensive iteration and flight test, 
more optimal design is only possible if the conditions are known beforehand.  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress ... has been handicapped by the lack of sufficient data on the meteorological factors.<br>
<em>NACA-TN-1855, 1949.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A better understanding of the icing atmosphere evolved in parallel with improved 
<a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">Meteorological Instruments</a> in the years 1944 to 1952.
Two of the authors (Kline, Lewis) were meteorologists from the US Weather Bureau.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Ice protection system development continues to address new challenges.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Design guides can lead you to "adequate" designs for several technologies.  </li>
<li>Design guides provide procedures to compare candidate systems.  </li>
<li>Optimal designs and new requirements may require system development.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We have seen "the possible methods for overcoming the ice hazard" 
that were developed in the NACA-era in this <a href="/ice-protection.html">Ice Protection Thread</a>. 
The period up to and through WWII (1945) was largely characterized by expeditious tests to 
address immediate icing problems. </p>
<p>The quote above "The industry has now passed through the experimental stages of heating and anti-icing ..."
from 1946 was not completely the case, but NACA did move on to 
more planned scientific and engineering tests and analysis methods development. 
By the 1950's useful <a href="/design-manuals.html">Engineering Design Manuals</a> were available,

<p>An experimental investigation was conducted in a 3.84- by 10-inch

<p>A number of instruments used for determining the supercooled water content of an icing
cloud depend on measuring the rate of accretion of ice on an unheated body. It has been shown
by Ludlam that, since only part of the supercooled water freezes on impact, and the rest
cannot always be frozen by the limited convective and evaporative heat losses which are available, 
there are limiting …</p></blockquote>

<h1>“Aerodynamic Heating and Deflection of Drops by an Obstacle in an Airstream in Relation to Aircraft Icing"</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Water drop impingement on a cylinder is calculated.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The effect of aerodynamic heating is predictable</li>
<li>The impingement of water drops on a cylinder is calculated</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Two topics of interest to persons attempting to apply 
the heat method of preventing ice formation on aircraft 
are considered. Surfaces moving through air at high speed 
are shown, both theoretically and experimentally, to be 
subject to important aerodynamic heating effects that will 
materially reduce the heat required to prevent ice. </p>
<p>Numerical calculations of the paths of water drops 
in an air stream around a circular cylinder are given. 
From these calculations, information is obtained on the 
percentage of the swept area cleared …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>I have assembled a database of 210 NACA-NASA<a href="/the-non-naca-naca-icing-publications.html">*</a> icing publications. 132 were cited in “Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Aircraft Icing Publications” <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.

<p>The format of the citations in the NACA publications varies over the years. 
For the database, the citations were updated to a consistent format similar to MLA format 
(similar to that used in current NASA publications). </p>
<p>The document identifiers such as “NACA TN 1907” were updated to the format used in the NTRS,

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cylinder has a wide range of current uses in aviation:<br>
- Meteorological instruments for flight and icing wind tunnel tests<br>
- Aircraft in-flight ice detectors and indicators<br>
- Structural elements (such as landing gear and cables)<br>
- An approximation of an airfoil leading edge (used in thermal design and icing wind tunnel test conditions determination <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>)   </p>
<p>Icing conditions measurements with instruments based on cylinders were key to developing the 
current aircraft flight in icing certification regulations.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-two NACA publications related to aircraft icing were 
identified in <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">"The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications"</a>, 
and categorized into 16 topics.</p>

<p>Many new aircraft icing problems aren’t new at all. 
Like excavating a lost city, many surprises, answers to problems, 
road maps, and confirmations can be found in the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). 
This treasure trove of data can help you today. </p>
<p>Why care about aircraft icing?  If ice forms on a plane during flight, it can be hazardous. 
Engineers research the weather conditions aircraft will encounter and work to ensure that 
they can navigate them safely. </p>
