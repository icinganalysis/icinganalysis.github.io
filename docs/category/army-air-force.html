<p><img alt="Figure 6. Trajectories of rim particles deposited on cylinder AC drawn by differential analyzer." src="images/Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories/LangmuirFigure6.png">  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Langmuir drop size distributions are defined, and water drop impingement on a collection of cylinders for use as an icing instrument is described.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Langmuir drop size distributions are defined</li>
<li>The water drop impingement terms E, Beta, K, and Ko are defined</li>
<li>The use of cylinders of different sizes and detailed calculations to determine water drop sizes</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Calculations are given of the trajectories of small water droplets 
moving in air at high velocities across a cylinder. The calculations were 
made by means of a differential analyzer (D.A.). A few calculations are
also given for the case of a sphere and a ribbon.</p>
<p>Each D. A. trajectory represents the motion of a single particle. The theoretical curves for
the efficiency of deposition of very large numbers of particles were derived from the D. A. data
on the assumption that all the particles in a given fog were of uniform size.</p>
<p>The theoretical curves can be used to analyze experimental data. For example, if measurements
are made of the rate of rime deposition on two or more cylinders under the same fog conditions,
the cylinders having different radii, a comparison of these data with the theoretical curves 
provides a method of calculating the size of the particles that were collected and the liquid water
content of the fog.</p>
<p>It is known, however, that in general the particles in fogs are not of uniform size. The effect
which a distribution of particle size has on the results became apparent when measurements
made with three or more cylinders having different radii were compared with the theoretical
data. It was usually found that the curvature of the experimental plot was not quite the same
as that of the theoretical curve. A method was devised for taking into account certain assumed
distributions of particle size. It was found that the experimental data fitted the theoretical data
much better after this had been done.</p>
<p>An example is given of the analysis of experimental data by means of the theoretical curves.
It is shown that when three or more cylinders are used it is possible to estimate the distribution
of particle size by graphical methods. The experimental data used in the example were obtained
by R. M . Cunningham in an airplane. The application of the method is given for the case of data
taken under other conditions, such as those at the attitude of Mt. Washington [New Hampshire, USA]. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is not a NACA publication, but it is an important link in the chain of NACA citations. 
It is an example of important, contemporary work done outside NACA.
This is the most cited icing publication that I know of (700+ citations on scholar.google <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>).
This reference merits much study, 
but at this time I will limit the discussion to the pertinent points in the NACA citation chain. </p>
<h3>A note on publications</h3>
<p>This work was published three times, in <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, and <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (with slightly different titles). 
The first was a preliminary version, and the second was the final version, which is more extensive. 
The third appears to be substantially similar to <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, with a slight change in title. 
Many citations are specifically for <sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The images in an online version of <sup id="fnref3:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> are of poor quality, so selected text and tables were transcribed herein. </p>
<h3>Drop size distribution</h3>
<p>Table IX defines "assumed" water drop size distributions. 
Reference <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> clarifies that the "B" distribution comes from, apparently, 
a single case of drop size measurement in <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> (apparently by an oil slide method). 
The post <a href="/a-langmuir-b-drop-size-distribution-is-almost-a-normal-distribution.html">"A Langmuir B distribution is (almost) a normal distribution"
</a> 
will examine the data more thoroughly. </p>
<p>For an assumption, these distributions have taken hold for more than 75 years, 
and are still cited in recent publications 
(for example, AC 20-73A <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> [2006] recommends the use of a Langmuir D distribution). </p>

<p>I suspect that most recent citations have been for the drop size distributions and not other aspects,
but I have not read through 700+ references to confirm this.</p>
<h3>Water drop impingement terms</h3>
<p>While <a href="/naca-tn-779.html">NACA-TN-779</a> <sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> presented results as dimensional, this publication put values in non-dimensional terms.

<h3>Multi-cylinder icing instruments</h3>
<p>The water drop collection efficiency E for a given icing condition is a function of water drop size.
If all the water freezes, then the mass gathered on different size cylinder can be measured 
and the water drop median size and size distribution inferred.</p>
<p>The "if all the water freezes" assumption will be examined in the 
<a href="/icing-thermodynamics.html">Icing Thermodynamics Thread</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example of the Application of the D.A. Data to Experimental Data:<br>
In the early work that was done before the D.A. study was made, a method
was developed for analyzing the experimental data that were obtained at the
Mt. Washington Observatory. These data were measurements of the ice collected 
on two or more rotating cylinders under various conditions. This work
has been described in the Report to the A.R.L. 
"Super-Cooled Droplets in Rising Currents of Cold Saturated Air", Parts I and II by Irving Langmuir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a single cylinder with a single water drop size, 
Langmuir compared results from his analysis with those of Kantrowitz <sup id="fnref2:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Table IV (a) gives comparison of the Kantrovitz data (Restricted Report,
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) with the new data from the
D.A. The Kantrovitz data were calculated for particles travelling at a high
velocity, ν = 8940 cm/sec. They correspond to the case φ = 16,000. The
data from which βo can be calculated were not given in the Kantrovitz Report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as this is in a section label "φ = 0", and the reference <sup id="fnref3:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> data is purportedly at φ = 16000, 
this is perhaps not the most meaningful comparison.
