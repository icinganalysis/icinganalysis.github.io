<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Evaluation of the rotating multicylinder method for the measurement
of droplet-size distribution, volume-median droplet size, and liquid-water 
content in clouds shoved that small uncertainties in the basic
data eliminate the distinction between different cloud droplet-size
distributions and are a source of large errors in the determination of
the droplet size. Calculations of the trajectories of cloud droplets
in an incompressible-air flow field around a cylinder were performed on
a mechanical analog constructed for the study of the trajectories of
droplets around aerodynamic bodies. Many data points were carefully
calculated in order to determine precisely the rate of droplet impingement 
on the surface of a right circular cylinder.</p>
<p>Matching curves for obtaining droplet-size distribution, volume-median 
droplet size, and liquid water content from flight data were
computed from the results of the droplet trajectory calculations. An
evaluation is presented of the rotating multicylinder method for the
measurement of droplet-size distribution, volume median droplet size,
and liquid-water content in clouds. Because of the insensitivity of
the multicylinder method to changes in conditions in clouds, and the
inaccuracies in obtaining flight data, errors as large as 70 percent
in the determination of the volume-median droplet size are possible if
the flight speed is 200 miles per hour and the actual volume-median
droplet diameter in the cloud is 30 microns.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The online pdf available for this publication is one of the best reproductions in the NACA series, 
with clear graphics. 
The 22 by 17 inch version of cylinder water catch efficiency vs K in Figure 6 is beautiful, 
and this online format cannot do full justice to it 
(go download the pdf and view it on a large screen). 
And if you can ever view the original print it is even better.</p>

<h3>Detailed water drop impingement analysis</h3>
<p>A differential analyzer was used to calculate the water drop trajectories. 
Appendix A of NACA-TN-2904 provides much detail. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the principles of operation of the
mechanical analogy are reviewed herein, and a machine setup together
with all the pertinent computations involved for a representative trajectory are presented.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Figure 15 below, two investigators turn the input cranks to produce output rotation on the pen plotter in the middle. 
<em>(Unfortunately, their names were not recorded in NACA-TN-2904.)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The method used in reference 3 for calculating the water-droplet
trajectories has been used for calculating the data presented herein. 
Many more data points were carefully calculated for the results presented 
herein than were calculated for the data in reference 3, in order
to determine more precisely the rate of impingement of droplets on the
surface of the cylinder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Reference 3" is Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. 
It is not readily evident that NACA-TN-2904 calculated many more data points than <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. 
While the data tables are comparable, 
Table XI of <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> actually has more data points in it than NACA-TN-2904 Table IV.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accuracy was emphasized in all the calculations, 
because the sensitivity of the rotating multicylinder method in
its application does not permit wide tolerances in the theoretical data.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accuracy was emphasised, and the final results are slightly different than those in <sup id="fnref4:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. 
But it is not clear from the data presented in NACA-TN-2904 that it is more accurate than <sup id="fnref5:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<h3>Error estimates</h3>
<p>The values in Figure 14b agree with this statement from the "Summary", 
which shows a "possible error" of 70% for the case given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the insensitivity of
the multicylinder method to changes in conditions in clouds, and the
inaccuracies in obtaining flight data, errors as large as 70 percent
in the determination of the volume-median droplet size are possible if
the flight speed is 200 miles per hour and the actual volume-median
droplet diameter in the cloud is 30 microns.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 14b. Expected errors in the determination of voluem-median drop size, +/-10% cylinder mass error" src="images/naca-tn-2904/Figure14b.png"></p>
<p>However, Figure 14b is for an assumed cylinder mass measurement error of +/-10%, 
which seems large compared to other error estimates. 
Also, the errors have to be in a worst-case stack-up to achieve the 70% difference value. 
Thus, I would not consider this value to be "typical".</p>
<h3>Beta curves</h3>
<p>This includes detailed Beta (local impingement efficiency) curves, 
which may be used to develop a Beta curve for a specific condition. 
These will be used extensively in NACA-TN-3338 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p><img alt="Local impingement efficiency as a function of cylinder angle, Phi=10000" src="images/naca-tn-2904/Fig10BetaPhi10000.png"></p>
<p>These are based on detailed analysis shown in figure 9:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9 (d) Phi=10000. Trajectory starting ordinates as a function of angle of impingement" src="images/naca-tn-2904/Figure9_phi_10000.png"></p>
<p>The text says in one place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An analysis of the data points shown in figure 9 reveals that all
the points fell on sine curves, with amplitude and period depending on
the values of К and ф studied. The reason for this behavior is not
apparent from a study of the equations of motion (equations (l) and (2)),
which are very nonlinear and do not permit a formal solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Figure 10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curves of Beta as a function of Phi in addition to those curves
given in figure 10 can be found from the relation</p>
<p><img alt="Beta=pi/2*Em/Theta_m*cos(pi/2*Theta/Theta_m)" src="images/naca-tn-2904/beta_cos.png"></p>
<p>where theta is measured in radians. This relation applies on the assumption 
that the curves in figure 9 are sine curves for which the amplitude
is characterized by y_o_m = Em and the period bу Theta_m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption that the Beta curves are cosine curves appears to be an approximation.
Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref6:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> did not provide Beta curves, but did provide maximum Beta (Beta_o) values. 
The Beta_o values do not agree well between sources:  </p>

<h3>A difference from Langmuir and Blodgett for drop size distributions calculations</h3>
<p>As noted in NACA-TN-2904, for drop size distributions Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref7:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> used an approximation, 
using the k*phi value for the MVD for every drop size bin when calculating the weighted Em value. 
This means essentially that for part of the calculation (the k*phi value) the MVD drop size was used for every bin, 
and for the other part (the k value) the drop size was unique for each bin.
A more technically correct implementation is to have a unique k*phi value for each bin
(both the k and the k*phi parts). 
I could not find in Langmuir and Blodgett where they were explicit about this detail of their method, 
and it was an astute observations made in NACA-TN-2904 to notice this. </p>
<p>Both the original Langmuir and Blodgett multicylinder calculations, 
and a version with unique k*phi for each bin were implemented in 
<a href="/implementation-of-cylinder-impingement-correlations-in-python.html">"Implementation of cylinder impingement correlations in Python"</a>.
A comparison to Table XI values of <sup id="fnref8:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> verifies that the "k*phi value for the MVD" method was used.</p>
<p>We will see a comparison of results of the different methods for a multicylnder case in the upcoming review of NACA-RM-E53D23.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>It is not clear from the data presented in NACA-TN-2904 that its method is more accurate than Langmuir and Blodgett <sup id="fnref9:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
I do not know of contemporaneous data that could resolve which method is more accurate.
And even with data from the post-NACA era it is difficult to determine that one method is 
substantially more accurate than the other. 
This will be a subject covered in the upcoming <a href="/conclusions-of-the-cylinder-thread.html">Conclusions of the Cylinder Thread</a>. </p>
