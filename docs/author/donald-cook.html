<p><img alt="NACA credo." src="/images%2FNACA_credo.jpg"><br>
<em>From <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NACA_credo.jpg">commons.wikimedia.org</a>.</em>  </p>
<p>For most of the reviews of the NACA-era aircraft icing publications, 
I have tried to be neutral about whether one is "better" than another
(they all have merit), 
except for noting how often they were cited and used later. 
This may have de-emphasized some of the biggest achievements, 
which are often not contained in just one publication. </p>
<p>NACA did not invent several of these items. 
NACA did find good ideas from many sources, and collaborated with industry, academia, 
and other government entities. 
They fulfilled their mission statement several times.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it shall be the duty of the advisory committee for aeronautics to supervise and direct 
the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution ...  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have selected six "Crowning Achievements" of the NACA-era.  </p>
<p>Two have received formal recognition in other sources 
(robust ice protection, the Icing Research Tunnel).  </p>
<p>There are four others that I feel have been under-appreciated.  </p>
<p>NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
provides several observations.  </p>
<h2>Robust ice protection</h2>
<p>One indication of the contemporary importance of the NACA efforts was 
the National Aeronautic Association 1946 Collier Trophy award to Lewis Rodert of NACA 
“For his pioneering research and guidance in the development and practical application of a thermal ice prevention system for aircraft.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>Note that the NACA efforts achieved complete, robust airplane ice protection. 
Protection for the wings and engines often gets the most attention, 
but flight in icing can quickly reveal other components that are not adequately protected, 
such as windshields, airspeed instruments, antennas, etc. 
See <a href="/component-icing.html">Component Ice Protection</a>.  </p>
<p>From <a href="/naca-tn-2569.html">NACA-TN-2569</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A total of 305 traverses of cumuliform clouds by P-61C airplanes were made in icing conditions, and on no occasion did ice accumulate before the end of a traverse to such an extent as to make safe flight impossible.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cumuliform clouds are associated with a higher rate of icing call Intermittent Maximum Icing. 
Before the NACA efforts for ice protection, 305 traverses would have been fool-hardy.  </p>
<p>It is notable that this was accomplished prior to the other achievements noted here. 
The was little knowledge of the icing atmosphere, as adequate instruments were not yet available. 
The Icing Research Tunnel was used, but it was found to not yet be adequate for the task. 
Ice protection thermodynamic analysis was developing at the time, but was of limited use, 
partly because the key values of icing conditions were not well known. 
Robust ice protection soon enabled advancement in other areas, 
particularly measuring icing conditions in flight. </p>

<h2>The Icing Research Tunnel</h2>
<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognized the IRT as an 
"International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark" in 1987 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. </p>

<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a>, 
which has more information on the history of the Icing Research Tunnel. </p>
<p>The Icing Research Tunnel is still used today, for both research and industry tests. 
Numerous improvements through time have enabled an 80+ year life span.  </p>

<h2>The rotating multicylinder instrument</h2>
<p>Without reliable instruments, 
one could not know what icing conditions are likely to be encountered, 
and reliable test and design could not proceed.  </p>
<p>The rotating multicylinder instrument was assessed over and over again
(that is why there is an entire <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">Icing on Cylinders Thread</a> with 17 posts). 
It was at times criticised, but there was no better instrument in the NACA-era 
(see the <a href="/conclusions-of-the-meteorological-instruments-thread.html">Conclusions of the Meteorological Instruments Thread</a>).  </p>
<p>Nobel Prize awardee Iring Langmuir (1932 for surface chemistry), together with Katherine Blodgett, 
put the analysis of the instrument on a sound theoretical footing. 
Even that was criticised, 
but more recent assessments show that the Langmuir and Blodgett analysis was accurate. </p>

<h2>Thermodynamic models of ice formation</h2>
<p>NACA progressed from the early, "cut-and-try testing of components" to 
"the design of heated wings on a fundamental, wet-air basis now can be undertaken with reasonable certainty."  </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rinaldo J. Brun, William Lewis, Porter Perkins, and John
Serafini produced a technical report [NACA-TR-1215] that calculated the impingement rate of cloud droplets on the
rotating multicylinder. The report shows a solid command of boundary layer theory, heat transfer,
experimental physics, and instrumentation that sets it strikingly apart from the simple empiricism
of the reports of the mid-1940s. The discipline had indeed been placed on a rational basis.</p>

<h2>The icing design requirements</h2>
<p>It is difficult to design and test an ice protection system if the icing flight environment
(liquid water content, water drop size, temperature, and other factors) 
are not well known. </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> [emphasis added]:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1946 Lewis Rodert took charge of the icing program at the Cleveland laboratory. In a
March 1947 memo, Rodert stressed the importance of gathering statistical data on icing clouds.
These data would allow the Civil Aeronautics Administration to craft regulations to certify new
aircraft if they met guidelines in providing ice-protection equipment. Reliable data were needed
because of the <strong>"general disagreement over what constitutes a safe design basis for the heated
wing."</strong>  The Cleveland and Ames laboratories collaborated on this program.  </p>
<p>By 1948 the program had logged a total of 249 icing encounters and had taken about 1000
measurements of liquid water content and droplet diameter. This was a collaborative flight
research program carried out by the Air Force in the upper Mississippi Valley, by Ames in the
West, and by Lewis Laboratory in the Great Lakes area. John H. Enders, an intrepid pilot from
Cleveland's Flight Research program, flew the dangerous missions over Lake Erie, bringing back
his Consolidated bomber encrusted with ice. In October the NACA group presented a tentative
table of design conditions to the NACA Subcommittee on Icing Problems. This report defined the
parameters for which icing protection was necessary for safe operation. The statistical data in
this NACA report became the basis for the design criteria for federal requirements for aircraft
icing protection adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in the mid-1950s. In reflecting
on the success of this effort, William Lewis wrote in 1969, "Considering the fact that we had data
from 167 encounters in layer clouds and 73 in cumulus, statistical extrapolation to a probability
of 1/1000 was more than daring, it was down right foolhardy" Nevertheless, more recent research
using a much larger data base confirmed the conclusions of the 1949 report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "NACA Report" is <a href="/naca-tn-1855.html">NACA-TN-1855</a>,

<em>from <a href="/the-icing-problem.html">The Icing Problem</a></em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NACA tests, valuable though they were, 
would not be so useful if analysis could not fit the data.  </p>
<p>From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref4:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To verify whether tests in the tunnel accurately reproduced actual
flight conditions, the heat transfer data obtained by J. K. Hardy at Ames in his famous study of
the heated wing were compared to tests on the same wing mounted in the icing tunnel. The data
were in agreement.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "famous study" was <a href="/naca-tr-831.html">NACA-TR-831</a>,
the tunnel comparison was <a href="/thermal-analysis-and-surface-wettedness.html">NACA-TN-2480</a>.  </p>
<p>Design manuals encapsulate the knowledge in reusable forms.  </p>
<p>Fully half of the citations in <a href="/ads-4.html">FAA-ADS-4 “Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data”, 1963</a> 
are NACA publications. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>"... Before attacking what appeared to be a new icing problem we should study the icing work of the 1940's and 50's." <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I started blogging on this topic in three years ago, 
I had worked for 30+ years in aircraft icing, 
and I had several occasions to study the NACA icing publications in particular. 
I thought that I knew the publications well. </p>
<p>I was wrong. There is much more to be learned. As I studied the publications again, 
I often had thoughts similar to comments that the website "Blast from the Past: NACA Icing Publications" has received:  </p>
<ul>
<li>"Stuff I was looking for"  </li>
<li>"it enlightened me a lot for my ongoing research"  </li>
<li>"an invaluable source of material"  </li>
<li>"I've been looking for that data point!"  </li>
</ul>
<p>Searching through and reading the NACA publications will reward you, 
at whatever stage of learning you are at. </p>
<p>The NACA publications are available at no cost at <a href="ntrs.nasa.gov">ntrs.nasa.gov</a>.  </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This paper summarizes some of the techniques used in N.A.C.A. research programs, 
in flight and in tunnels, to solve aircraft icing problems and it indicates 
the scope of the data available for the design of aircraft icing protection systems. 
Sufficient data have been obtained, generalized where possible, and techniques have 
been established whereby icing-protection requirements for most aircraft components 
can be determined sufficiently accurately for engineering purposes. 
The Appendices discuss the icing facilities at the N.A.C.A. Lewis laboratory in detail, 
specific test equipment and techniques used in conducting tests in icing wind tunnels, 
and several icing instruments.  </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The formation of ice on aircraft in flight is caused by the freezing 
of supercooled liquid -water droplets as they strike the exposed surfaces
of the aircraft. Icing conditions exist, therefore, when free water 
in the liquid state is present in the air at temperatures below
freezing.<br>
Such conditions are frequently found in clouds, but not all clouds 
at subfreezing temperatures produce icing.
Some clouds are composed
entirely of ice crystals, which, in the absence of liquid water, do not
adhere to the aircraft and therefore do not cause icing.
Subfreezing
clouds thus may be divided into three classes depending on whether they
are composed of ice crystals, liquid-water droplets, or a mixture of
crystals and drops.
The latter two types, liquid and mixed clouds, are
icing clouds …</p></blockquote>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>Heating requirements for satisfactory cyclic de-icing over a wide
range of icing and operating conditions have been determined for a gas-heated, 
36° swept airfoil of 6.9-foot chord with a partial-span leading-edge slat. 
Comparisons of heating requirements and effectiveness were
made between the slatted and unslatted portions of the airfoil. Studies
were also made comparing cyclic de-icing with continuous anti-icing, and
cyclic de-icing systems with and without leading-edge ice-free parting
strips. De-icing heat requirements were approximately the same with either 
heated or unheated parting strips because of the aerodynamic effects
of the 36° sweep angle and the spanwise saw-tooth profile of leading-edge
glaze-ice deposits. Cyclic de-icing heat-source requirements were found
to be one-fourth or less of the heat requirements for …</p></blockquote>

the quickest and most reliable ice removal. Heating requirements for the

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of low-density ice has been computed from
data obtained in an experimental investigation of the heat transfer and
mass transfer by sublimation for an iced surface on a flat plate in a
high-velocity tangential air stream.  </p>
<p>The results are compared with data from several sources on the
thermal conductivity of packed snow and solid glaze ice. The results
show good agreement with the equations for the thermal conductivity of
packed snow as a function of snow density. The agreement of the curves
for packed snow near the solid ice regime with the values of thermal
conductivity, of ice indicates that the curves are applicable over the
entire-ice-density range.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Measurements of propeller efficiency loss due to ice formation are
supplemented by an analysis to establish the magnitude of efficiency
losses to be anticipated during flight in icing conditions. The measurements 
were made during flight in natural icing conditions; whereas the
analysis consisted of an investIgation of changes in blade-section 
aerodynamic characteristics caused by ice formation and the resulting 
propeller efficiency changes. Agreement in the order of magnitude of 
efficiency losses tobe expected is obtained between measured and analytical
results. The results indicate that, in general, efficiency losses can
be expected to be less than 10 percent; whereas maximum losses, which
will be encountered only rarely, may be as high as 15 or 20 percent.
Reported. losses larger than 15 or 20 percent, based …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The heat requirements for the icing protection of two radome configurations

Both the protection limits of a typical thermal protection system and
the relative effects of the various icing variables have been determined.
For full evaporation of all impinging water, an effective heat density
of 14 watts per square inch was required. When a combination of the
full evaporation and running-wet surface systems was employed, a heat
requirement of 5 watts per square inch provided protection at severe
icing and operating conditions.  </p>

<p>Vibration and icing determinations on a CAA type V-109 very-

<p>An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the penetration of air jets directed perpendicularly to

penetration at a position downstream of the orifice was determined as a function of jet density, jet velocity, 
air-stream density, air-stream velocity, effective jet diameter, and orifice flow coefficient. 
The jet penetrations were determined for nearly constant values of air-stream density at three tunnel-air

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Five of these publications are from the "Jet Penetration" section, 
and one is from the "Windshield Ice Protection" section 
of <a href="The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md">The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications</a>.  </p>
<p>The first five publications determine by test the characteristics of air jets entering a moving airstream. 
The final publication applies this technology to windshield rain removal.  </p>
<p>Windshield rain removal is often designed in the same group as ice protection. 
SAE AIR-1168/4 is titled “Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection” [SAE Aerospace Applied Thermodynamics Manual, 1969 (regularly updated, currently document <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air1168/4/">sae.org</a>)]. 
A design group I worked in was named "Ice and Rain Protection". </p>
<p>That was historically where the knowledge of water drops, 
air flow control, and mechanical systems resided. </p>
<p>So, it is not surprising that a rain-removal publication is in the

<blockquote>
<p>Investigations have been made in flight and in wind tunnels tc
determine which components of turbojet installations are most critical
in icing conditions, and to evaluate several methods of icing protection. 
From these studies, the requirements necessary for adequate
icing protection and the consequent penalties on engine performance
can be estimated.  </p>
<p>Because investigations have indicated that the compressor-inlet
screen constitutes the greatest icing hazard and is difficult to protect, 
complete removal or retraction of the screen upon encountering
an icing condition is recommended. In the absence of the screen, the
inlet guide vanes of an axial-flow-type turbojet engine constitute the
greatest danger to engine operation in an icing condition; a centrifugal-

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation was conducted to determine the electric power
requirements necessary for ice protection of inlet guide vanes by continuous 
heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show
the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air
velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements
for these two methods of ice protection.<br>
The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 inlet
guide vanes under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide 
a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for
continuous heating. Heat-on periods in the order of 10 seconds with a
cycle ratio of about 1:7 …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A photographic technique for investigating water droplets of diameter 
less than 200 microns falling freely in air at temperatures between
0° C and -50° C has been devised and used to determine:<br>
(1) The shape of frozen droplets<br>
(2) The occurrence of collisions of partly frozen or of frozen and
liquid droplets<br>
(3) The statistics on the freezing temperatures of individual
free-falling droplets  </p>
<p>A considerable number of droplets were found to have a non-spherical
shape after freezing because of various protuberances and frost growth,
and droplet aggregates formed by collision. The observed frequency of
collision of partly frozen droplets showed good order of magnitude agreement 
with the …</p></blockquote>

<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A Bragg X-ray spectrometer equipped with a volume-sensitive Geiger 
counter and Soller slits and employing filtered molybdenum Kα, radiation 
was used to obtain a set of diffracted intensity curves as a function 
of angle for supercooled water. Diffracted intensity curves in 
the temperature region of 21° to -16° C were obtained. The minimum
between the two main diffraction peaks deepened continuously with 
lowering temperature, indicating a gradual change in the internal 
structure of the water. No discontinuity in this trend was noted at 
the melting point. The internal structure of supercooled water was
concluded to become progressively more ice-like as the temperature 
is lowered.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There was limited data for properties of liquid water below the temperature of 0° C (supercooled water) at the start of the NACA-era. 
The five studies reviewed here sought to improve the data available.  </p>
<p>The authors were well-informed of other studies available at the time. 
New instruments were conceived and built for these studies. </p>
<p>These five studies largely considered water drops, 
although much of the data are also applicable to more general aircraft icing analysis.  </p>
<p>Four of the studies concern the temperature at which supercooled water drops will

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need to have completed <a href="/anti-ice-heat-required-calculations.html">Anti-Ice Heat Required Calculations</a>.  </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Here, we will see that the values calculated by a multi-node analysis in LEWICE are 
comparable to the values calculated previously.  </p>
<p>Running LEWICE for anti-icing calculations involves (necessarily) more complex inputs. 
The user has to select which set of external heat transfer assumptions to use. 
The detailed output files require post-processing to extract the total heat required value. </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The LEWICE manual describes "deicer" cases that also may be used for 
anti-ice heat requirement analysis.<br>
An input is the "IDEICE" value in the case.inp file. 
By default, this is 0, and an unheated surface ice analysis is performed. 
However, with IDEICE &gt; 0, ice protection analysis is performed, 
as detailed in a cased.inp file. 
A key input in that file is ievap, which for the cases below is set to 
ievap=1 …</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need to have completed <a href="/anti-ice-heating-calculations-theory.html">Anti-Ice Heating Calculations Theory</a>.  </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this we will use "Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data", ADS-4, 
as the anti-ice examples are more detailed than those in the 
"Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1. </p>
<p>The ADS-4 analysis method uses NACA-TN-2799, from 1952, for the heat and mass balance calculations. 
This method implements solutions as nomographs (for more details, see the post <a href="/naca-tn-2799.html">NACA-TN-2799</a>). 
We will not be using the nomographs. 
The heat balance equations are similar to the Standard Computational Model, which we will use. </p>
<p>The calculations are implemented in the file "aircraft_a_ads4.py" (and associated files) 
available at <a href="https://github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io">github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io</a>. 
Readers are encouraged to run the analysis to the duplicate results.  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>"Aircraft Icing", AC 20-73A, briefly mentions the terms Qa and Qr:</p>
<blockquote>

Qr   Heat required </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We will review "Engineering Summary of Airframe Icing Technical Data", ADS-4 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0608865">apps.dtic.mil</a>, 
as the anti-ice examples are more detailed than those in the 
"Aircraft Icing Handbook Volume 1", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a>.  </p>
<p>We will also look at "Ice, Frost, and Rain Protection", SAE AIR1168/4 <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air1168/4/">sae.org</a>, for practical guidance for analysis.  </p>
<p>The ADS-4 and SAE AIR 1168/4 analysis methods use nomographs to implement graphical solutions. 
We will not be using the nomographs. 
While the notation is different, the analysis method from ADS-4 
is very similar to the Standard Computational Model in the 
<a href="/aircraft-icing-handbook-merged-sections.html#standard-computational-model">Aircraft Icing Handbook Merged Sections</a> 
which we will use here.  </p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To learn the energy terms and equations, readers should first review the 
<a href="/aircraft-icing-handbook-merged-sections.html#standard-computational-model">"Standard Computational Model"</a>, 
which combines the applicable sections original DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1 and the update into one text. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The term "standard computational model" has not seen wide use. 
Most recent literature refers to the "Messinger Model" or "Modified Messinger Model". 
That may or may not mean the "standard computational model" presented here. 
As noted for calculating evaporation:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a variety of formulations of this term.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That could also apply to several of the terms in the model. 
"Modified Messinger Model" could mean about anything, you would need to look at the details.  </p>
<p>The energy examples in the handbook are less detailed than the ones we previously saw for impingement. </p>
<p>The "Standard Computational Model" is implemented here in the python programming language 
and is available via 
<a href="https://github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/tree/main/icinganalysis">github.com/icinganalysis …</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The "Aircraft Icing Handbook" DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1, 1991 <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA238039.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a> 
had a perhaps little known update in 1993: <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA276499.pdf">apps.dtic.mil</a>.  </p>
<p>Several errors and omissions were corrected in the update, so it is essential to consult the update. </p>
<p>As the update only include certain affected pages, it makes it difficult to read 
as there is much interruption paging back and forth between sources. 
Here, selected sections of the two sources are merged for easier reading. </p>
<p>The reproduction quality of the online sources is variable, 
and parts of the update are barely legible. 
Here, the text is used (not just scanned images of text). 
In some cases, I have included text of the equations. </p>
<p>Some readers may prefer the online web formatting over the pdf formatting. 
The figures are included inline, again to reduce paging back and forth. 
The cited references are also noted here. Links to online …</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The "Aircraft Icing Handbook", DOT/FAA/CT-88/8-1, provides examples of two-dimensional water catch rates for the ice accretion process. </p>
<p>The Handbook uses something like "US Customary" or "Engineering" units in the calculations. 
This may limit the direct reuse of the equations. </p>
<p>These calculations can be reasonably accomplished through hand calculations, or a spreadsheet. 
However, they can be important "stepping stones" to build more complex capabilities. </p>
<p>Code written in the python programming language is available via 
<a href="https://github.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/tree/main/icinganalysis">github.com/icinganalysis</a>, 
file "intermeadiate/basics_water_catch_calculations.py" (and associated files) for the solutions, 
under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icinganalysis/icinganalysis.github.io/main/LICENSE">LGPL license</a>. 
Internally, the code uses (mostly) SI units 
(see <a href="/a-brief-digression-on-unit-systems.html">A Brief Digression on Unit Systems</a> for details). 
There are unit conversion functions in the python code. 
Values here are reported in the handbook units. </p>
<p>You are encouraged to run the provided code, 
or to start building your own …</p>

Areas include wing leading edges, propellers, windshield, radome,
essential instruments, auxiliary air inlets, engine air inlets,

<em>from <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0608865">ADS-4</a> (1963)</em>  </p>
<h3>Forms of ice protection</h3>
<p>There are several forms of ice protection used on airplanes. 
The most commonly used for is thermal ice protection, 
which provides heat to the area to be protected. </p>
<p>Thermal ice protection provides <a href="/terminology.html#anti-icing">"Anti-Icing"</a> protection.
Anti-icing with enough heating to
prevent the formation of ice by evaporating all of the impinging water is termed 
<a href="/terminology.html#fully-evaporative-anti-icing">"Fully evaporative anti-icing"</a>. 
This can be a demanding amount of power for large areas.  </p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <h3>Types of ice shapes</h3>
<p>As ice accumulates on a wing, it changes the shape of the airfoil. 
The ice that forms is sometimes called an <a href="/terminology.html#ice-accretion">"Ice accretion"</a> in the literature. 
The shape of the ice depends on details of the flight and icing conditions.  </p>
<p><a name="figure-glaze-ice"></a>
At warmer temperatures (about -10°C to 0°C, depending on airspeed and other factors), 
ice shapes tend to produce <a href="/terminology.html#glaze-ice">"Glaze Ice"</a> shapes with "horns". 
The nomenclature varies by domain. 
Pilot training materials generally note this type of ice as "Clear Ice".  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3-1. Clear or glaze ice forms on the leading edge of an airfoil, sometimes following the contour of the airfoil. 
Sometimes prominent &quot;horns&quot; also form." src="/images%2FAC-91-74B%2FFigure%203-1.png">   </p>

<p><a name="figure-rime-ice"></a>
At colder temperatures, the ice appears milky and opaque, and is termed <a href="/terminology.html#rime-ice">"Rime Ice"</a>.  </p>

<p>The water that causes most aircraft in-flight icing is small drops in clouds. 
Average drop sizes are typically 10 to 50 <a href="/terminology.html#micrometer">"Micrometers"</a> (μm) in diameter
(for comparison, a human hair is about 50 to 100 micrometers in diameter).</p>
<p><img alt="Typical water drop sizes. Icing clouds are typically in the 10 to 50 micrometer diameter range. Drizzle is 100 micrometers and up, while rain is typically 1000 micrometers." src="/images%2Fdrop%20sizes.png"><br>
<em>Typical drop sizes, approximately proportional. Public domain image by Donald Cook.</em>  </p>
<p>In a particular cloud, not all water drops are the same size. 
The <a href="/terminology.html#langmuir-distribution">"Langmuir Drop Size Distributions"</a> describe an idealized approximation of 
how the drop sizes vary in a cloud about an average or median drop size. 
It has seven bins, each with a representative drop size and fraction of the 
total water content in the cloud.  </p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <h3>Effects of icing in flight</h3>
<p>Airplanes can fly because engines produce thrust that propels it forward, 
and wings produce lift to counteract weight. </p>
<p>A wing is a well-shaped airfoil that can produce lift with minimal drag. 
If ice accumulates on a wing in flight, that changes the shape of the airfoil, 
which is then likely to not be as efficient at producing lift. 
Drag can also increase. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Basics provide "the least that you need to know" to begin the study of Aircraft Icing.  </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Basics acquaint you with the specialized terminology and concepts of aircraft in-flight icing. 
This is intended for engineers, scientists, and administrators newly interested in aircraft icing, 
or for those familiar with some but not all aspects of aircraft icing. </p>
<p>The Basics assume little knowledge of aircraft, and do not require math skills 
(there are only a few numbers that give ranges of typical values). 
The Basics are short and minimal, "the least that you need to know".

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Basics introduce core concepts and vocabulary of aircraft icing with images, "the least that you need to know".  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The Basics seek to facilitate initial learning about aircraft icing by:  </p>
<ul>
<li>focus on the needs of beginning learners  </li>
<li>readily connecting to other resources for further learning  </li>
<li>maximizing reuse  </li>
<li>maximizing access  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other sources may not do these well.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>One of the most-read posts that I have written was 
<a href="/a-gentle-introduction-to-aircraft-icing.html">A Gentle Introduction to Aircraft Icing</a>, 
so I think that there is interest in this topic.  </p>
<h3>My learning experience</h3>
<p>I got a MSME degree from the University of Wisconsin Internal Combustion Engine lab. 
That prepared me well for some aspects of aircraft icing 
(heat transfer, thermodynamics, drop physics, computational fluid dynamics). 
However, that by itself was not enough. </p>
<p>When I started in an Aircraft Systems design group, it …</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>A series of test flights was conducted by the U. S. Navy over a 3-year 
period to evaluate the effects of icing on the operation of the
ZPG-2 airship. In supercooled. clouds, ice formed only on the forward
edges of small protuberances and wires and presented no serious hazard
to operation. Ice accretions of the glaze type which occurred in conditions 
described as freezing drizzle adversely affected various components
to a somewhat greater extent. The results indicated, a need for protection 
of certain components such as antennas, propellers, and certain
parts of the control system.  </p>
<p>The tests showed that icing of the large …</p></blockquote>

<p>Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in

Several publications by Porter Perkins were included in 
[The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications]({filename}The%20Historical%20Selected%20Bibliography%20of%20NACA-NASA%20Icing%20Publications.md) 
in the "Meteorology of Icing Clouds" section. 
While the publications are important and useful, 
they did not directly affect the icing design values adopted in regulations. 
-->
<p>The first several publications are only briefly described, 
as their major results are incorporated into the final publication, 
NASA Memo 1-19-59E, which will be reviewed at length. </p>
<p>Note that NACA-RM-E52J06 outlines the need for data from broader sources, that is a theme in these publications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The majority of the research flights into icing conditions were
made by attempting to select weather conditions, flight paths, and altitudes, 
which would yield heavy or continuous icing. Multiple traverses
were often made when such conditions were found. It is impossible,
therefore, to determine from this information the extent or frequency
of specified icing …</p></blockquote>

<p>While no one is identified in Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904, 
I speculate that these investigators are 
Helen M. Gallagher, and Dorothea E. Vogt. 
(I do not know which name goes with which individual). 
While neither Gallager nor Vogt is credited in NACA-TN-2904, 
it is possible that they contributed to the analysis,

<p>Yes, I have used this figure a lot, as it is one of the best of the hundreds I have viewed from the NACA-era. 
This image is also notable in that of the hundreds of NACA-era documents that I have read,

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>"Important general concepts" of impingement on engine inlets are illustrated. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the first title here, the use of potential flow to determine water-drop trajectories gets pushed to the limit. 
In a demonstration of the pragmatism that ran through much of the ice protection development at NACA, 
investigators produced results on configurations that could be analyzed that were close enough to 
real aircraft geometries. </p>
<p>In NACA-TN-3770, we enter the supersonic jet age, with a dye-tracer method test of

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Several methods were used to quantify the water-drop impingement on a surface, such as a wing. </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We already saw in the <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">Icing on Cylinders thread</a> calculations made for impingement on a cylinder. 
The technique was expanded in NACA-TN-1397 to include Joukowski type airfoils. 
This allowed a transformation of the flow solution around a cylinder to be mapped into airfoil coordinates, 
and then used to solve for water drop trajectory calculations, similar to those used for cylinders. </p>
<p>NACA-TN-1397 said one could calculate "the trajectory a single drop without the utilization of a differential analyzer". 
We saw the differential analyzer in the <a href="/icing-on-cylinders.html">Icing on Cylinders thread</a>,

<h1>Water Drop Impingement on Surfaces Thread</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Water-drop impingement quantification is key to aircraft ice protection design.  </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Part of designing for aircraft icing is determining how much ice the airplane can accumulate. 
For ice protection systems, determining how much water that might freeze hits a surface is a key detail. </p>
<p>An important effect is that the airflow around a surface such as a wing airfoil deflects water-drops, 
so that all of the water-drops in the frontal area view will not hit the surface.</p>
<p>Water-drop impingement quantification methods were developed to assess how many drops can hit where on a surface. 
Direct test methods involved the use of blotter paper to absorb water drops on a surface. 
Mathematical analysis of the paths individual water drops were developed …</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is one of the shortest post that I have written, 
as it is more outlining a mystery, that I have not yet sorted out, than a full review.  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In <a href="/conclusions-of-the-meteorology-of-icing-clouds-thread.html#tracking-lwc-values">Conclusions of the Meteorology of Icing Clouds Thread</a>, 
there is a time-line of how the NACA understanding of the icing conditions evolved, 
focussing on liquid water content (LWC) values. </p>
<p>In Canada, icing research was also being performed by the National Aeronautical Establishment (NAE). </p>
<p>Here, we will compare what was published in the 
University of Michigan Airplane Icing Information Course, in 1953,
to NACA data and the later Appendix C.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>An alternative view of how to correlate icing conditions to ice protection performance.  </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Several aspect of icing clouds physics are discussed. </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Supercooling and nucleation rates are key to the formation of icing clouds.   </li>
<li>Vapor pressure differences of liquid water and ice play a role.   </li>
<li>Tips are given for recognizing supercooled clouds.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This includes a theoretical understanding of the physics of icing clouds, 
but also practical tips, such as how to identify supercooled icing clouds in flight.  </p>
<p>While this is not a long lecture (11 pages), 
I left out of this review for brevity items such as the artificial seeding of clouds, 
which is only tangentially related to aircraft icing, 
although I will briefly discuss that here. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Liquid-water content, droplet size, and temperature data measured 
during 22 flights in predominantly stratiform clouds through the
1948-49 and the 1949-50 winters are presented. Several icing encounters 
were of greater severity than those previously measured over the
same geographical area, but were within the limits of similar measurements 
obtained over different terrain within the United States.
An analysis of meteorological conditions existing during the
74 flights conducted for four winters indicated an inverse relation

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The thermal analysis of icing conditions has unique challenges, 
including the determination of heat transfer coefficients and fraction of the surface wetted.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Measured heat transfer coefficients in dry air can be different between flight and tunnel tests, due to free stream turbulence. </li>
<li>Icing conditions tend to promote more turbulent flow on the surface.  </li>
<li>Assumptions about the fraction of the surface wetted aft of impingement affect the thermal analysis.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Combustion heated air, independent of the engines, was used on some aircraft.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA.  </li>
<li>38 NACA publications detail technical aspects of aircraft heaters, 
including many details on heat exchangers, maturing engineering designs.  </li>
<li>Three publications deal with heat transfer for ice protection.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>There were numerous NACA publications on aircraft heaters. 
For the combustion heaters, air was scooped in, 
heated by burning aviation gasoline, 
and used for cabin heating, and wing ice protection on some airplanes
(The DC-6, for example). </p>
<p>Combustion heaters were developed independently of NACA 
prior to these NACA publications. 
However, the NACA publications very much detailed 
the design of not just the heaters, 
but also associated heat exchangers and components, 
as well as data needed for analysis

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Electrothermal deicing is studied in the NACA-era.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The power levels required for continuous anti-ice are challenging, so deicing was persued.  </li>
<li>Runback ice and residual ice are challenges for deicing.  </li>
<li>Analogue computers calculated transient heating and deicing.  </li>
<li>A chordwise-sequenced zone heating ice shedding strategy was devised.  </li>
<li>The current 787 jet aircraft uses electrothermal heating for wing anti-icing and de-icing.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The electric powered deicing of propeller blades, 
as well as wing leading edges, 
was studied by NACA.  </p>
<p>The deicing of propellers is perhaps easier in some ways, 
as the centrifugal of the spin greatly aids the shedding of ice. 
Also, there are scale differences, as a wing airfoil 
usually has a larger chord length than a propeller. 
However …</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Compressed air heating becomes common for ice protection in the jet era.  </p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>To support jet engine powered transportation, NACA had several studies of ice protection using compressed air heating.  </li>
<li>Deicing schemes were proposed to reduce the amount of air bled from the engines.  </li>
<li>Some innovative features, like continuously heated parting strips and 
recirculating hot air supply, did not see much use.  </li>
<li>Compressed air heating is used widely today for jet powered transports.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As aviation entered the jet propulsion age, 
reciprocating-engine exhaust heat was not an option. 
However, the jet engine air compressor offers an ample 
(but not unlimited) supply of hot, compressed air that may be bled 
from the engine compressor airstream 
for ice protection, cabin heating, and other functions. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Numerous methods were tested to find effective aircraft ice protection in the NACA-era.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>During the war, more than a hundred cargo planes of the Air Transport Command, 
flying from bases in India over the Hump to battlefronts in China, crashed
in the Himalayas. Most of them were brought down by ice. In a single day in 1944,
nine of these big Army transports, loaded with sorely needed supplies for the Allies’
fighting forces, were lost.<br>
Many of the fatal crashes of commercial aviation have been traced to this same
cause. For years commercial transports have been equipped with anti-icing devices,
but the apparatus in common use was designed to assist in meeting an emergency
when it arises, not to prepare the plane for deliberate flight into ice clouds. 
If dangerous icing conditions are inadvertently encountered …</p></blockquote>

<p>The state of the art in 1969 of aircraft icing is documented in 16 presentations.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject of aircraft ice protection has provoked much controversy
and discourse among theorists, designers, laboratory and test
engineers, and flight operations people. In view of this diversity
of opinion and variety of approach, some difficulty has been
experienced in applying current standards and in maintaining
uniformity in the substantiation of aircraft ice protection.
This symposium recognized the need to exchange ideas and it
provided a general review of icing criteria, ice protection
standards, methods of compliance, and service experience. It
also served as a general refresher for Federal Aviation Administration
personnel involved in the evaluation of aircraft ice protection.
Technical papers were presented by government research and test …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Three strategies were explored for water drop imaging.<br>
In NACA-RM-E50K01a, a telephoto arrangement allowed imaging water drops in situ.<br>
In NACA-RM-E51G05, water drops were put through a particle size sorting cascade, impacting on slides, and imaged.<br>
In NACA-TN-3592, water drops were captured in an oil stream exposed to the ambient flow, and then imaged.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Three methods for obtaining images of water drops are discussed.  </li>
<li>Images of enough water drops allowed the calculation of the drop size distribution.  </li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Supersaturated humidity can affect icing wind tunnel results.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Some observations of supersaturated humidity conditions were made in the NACA-era.  </li>
<li>Supersaturation was associated with frost on test article afterbodies.  </li>
<li>Recirculating icing wind tunnel conditions are calculated to tend to be supersaturated.  </li>
<li>Some potential effects of supersaturation are calculated.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>A brief primer on humidity</h2>
<p>A measurement of water vapor in the air is humidity. 
Relative humidity is the most common measure. 
In everyday life 30% to 60% relative humidity is generally considered to be comfortable. 
Lower humidities feel dry, and higher humidities feel wet or "humid".</p>
<p>The most water vapor that can usually exist at a given static temperature is termed
"saturated", and that condition has 100% relative humidity. 
Given sufficient time and condensation surfaces, 
any surplus vapor above this value will condense as liquid water. </p>

<p>Often, engine icing tests cannot be conducted at conditions that are considered the critical

find the desired conditions in natural icing flight tests. The use of ice scaling laws may
circumvent this testing limitation. Earlier studies (Refs. 1 and 2) of the application of ice
scaling (similitude) to aircraft engine testing indicated that experimental data were needed

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Calibration methods evolved during the NACA-era</p>

<ol>
<li>Early tests had informal calibrations, partly due to a limited understanding of the natural icing environment.  </li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As implied from the quote above from the year 1929, 
the calibration of an icing wind tunnel is often not just measuring what the facility produces, 
but also altering and improving the facility to achieve target values for water drop size and 
liquid water content, 
and producing a water drop spray that is uniform "enough". </p>

<p>An early icing wind tunnel and test are described</p>

<ol>
<li>An early icing wind tunnel with most of the components of current tunnels is described.  </li>
<li>A test of several coatings to prevent ice is detailed.  </li>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This investigation was conducted in the Refrigerated Wind
Tunnel at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley
Field, Virginia, to determine the effectiveness of various surface 
coatings as a means
for preventing ice formations on aircraft in flight.
The substances used as coatings for these tests are divided
into two groups:
compounds soluble in water, and those which are insoluble in water.
It was found that certain soluble compounds were apparently
effective in preventing the formation …</p></blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While there were extensive publications on how to use aerodynamic wind tunnels in the NACA-era 
(for example, Pope's "Wind Tunnel Testing" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), 
there was no reference for using icing wind tunnels that I could find, 
and I cannot think of a current publication that provides comprehensive guidance 
(there are publications that cover specific aspects, as we shall see in the thread). </p>
<p>This thread will not by itself correct that problem, but it will summarize uses, 
and perhaps provide some guidance by examples. </p>
<p>As there are numerous NACA publications (40+) that describe specific icing wind tunnel tests,
but only a little about the icing wind tunnel itself in each one, 
I will not have a detailed review of most of the individual publications in this thread. 
Instead …</p>

<h2>A Note</h2>
<p>I briefly worked with Ramon Wilder (circa 1991?), 
but I did not ask him about this particular publication. 
I (a much junior engineer) asked him off-handedly about a certain heat conduction equation. 
He said "I'll get back to you." 
The next day he came in with an elegant, hand-written, 10 page proof, and said 
"That was a little tough. It took me three hours last night!" 
That was the kind of engineer …</p>

<p>An experimental investigation was conducted in a 3.84- by 10-inch

of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 and pressure altitudes to 30,000 feet. Measurements

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For the <a href="/icing-thermodynamics.html">Thermodynamics tread</a> and on, I will be using this style guide. 
Previous code may eventually be upgraded to this.</p>
<h2>Python target version:</h2>
<p>Target python version 3.7, and the corresponding <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda stack</a> (version 2021-11). 
Avoid modules with deprecation warnings (there are not many of them).
This is a balance between current installations and future-proofing. 
The goal is to be applicable for all 3.7+ uses. </p>
<p>(Note: 3.10 is the latest available version, as of April 2022).</p>
<p>Code should be portable, and not use operating system specific functions. </p>
<h2>General guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>simple</p>
<ul>
<li>use simple functions over classes</li>
<li>out-source complexity where possible<ul>
<li>use built-in data structures (list, dict) </li>

<p>The thermal analysis of a heated surface in icing conditions has

design of cyclic thermal deicing systems that are attractive for
small high-speed aircraft for which thermal anti-icing requirements 
have become severe.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Langmuir B drop size distribution is almost a normal distribution.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Langmuir B drop size distribution is almost a normal distribution.  </li>
<li>Perhaps it was originally intended that it be exactly a normal distribution.</li>
<li>The proposed alternatives in NACA-TN-2708 appears to have larger errors, rather than correcting errors.</li>
<li>The other Langmuir distributions (C, D, E) do not fit a normal distribution as well.</li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Normal drop size distributions</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal distributions</a> show up many places in nature, 
so it is not surprising that drop sizes in clouds can approximate a normal distribution.  </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cylinder has a wide range of current uses in aviation:<br>
- Meteorological instruments for flight and icing wind tunnel tests<br>
- Aircraft in-flight ice detectors and indicators<br>
- Structural elements (such as landing gear and cables)<br>
- An approximation of an airfoil leading edge (used in thermal design and icing wind tunnel test conditions determination <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>)   </p>
<p>Icing conditions measurements with instruments based on cylinders were key to developing the 
current aircraft flight in icing certification regulations.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-two NACA publications related to aircraft icing were 
identified in <a href="/the-historical-selected-bibliography-of-naca-nasa-icing-publications.html">"The Historical Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications"</a>, 
and categorized into 17 topics.</p>

<p>Many new aircraft icing problems aren’t new at all. 
Like excavating a lost city, many surprises, answers to problems, 
road maps, and confirmations can be found in the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). 
This treasure trove of data can help you today. </p>
<p>Why care about aircraft icing?  If ice forms on a plane during flight, it can be hazardous. 
Engineers research the weather conditions aircraft will encounter and work to ensure that 
they can navigate them safely. </p>
