<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY  </p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of low-density ice has been computed from
data obtained in an experimental investigation of the heat transfer and
mass transfer by sublimation for an iced surface on a flat plate in a
high-velocity tangential air stream.  </p>
<p>The results are compared with data from several sources on the
thermal conductivity of packed snow and solid glaze ice. The results
show good agreement with the equations for the thermal conductivity of
packed snow as a function of snow density. The agreement of the curves
for packed snow near the solid ice regime with the values of thermal
conductivity, of ice indicates that the curves are applicable over the
entire-ice-density range.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION  </p>
<p>Removal of ice formations which accrete on aircraft surfaces from
the impingement and freezing of cloud droplets has been the subject of
a considerable amount of research in recent years. The accumulation of
ice on aircraft surfaces occurs over a range of air temperatures from
32° F to as low as -40° F (ref. 1). The ice formations may be nearly
clear glaze ice with little porosity, such as those formed at air temperatures 
near the freezing point, or they may be of the very porous
type characterized by frost or ice formed at low temperatures. Some
factors which affect the nature of the ice formations are the speed of
the aircraft and the cloud droplet size and droplet size distribution.  </p>
<p>Very few data are available on the physical properties of ice formations
having a density other than that of clear, solid ice. Since much of the
de-icing of aircraft is currently accomplished by the application of
heat to the surface to be de-iced, knowledge of the thermal conductivity
of ice is of importance in determining the heat lost through the ice.
A similar problem is encountered in the determination of heat-transfer
rates for frosted refrigeration equipment surfaces. A study of the mass
transfer by sublimation and the heat transfer for an iced surface in a
high-velocity air stream (ref. 2) required the determination of ice density, 
ice surface temperature, and rate of heat flow through the ice.
From these data, the thermal conductivity of low-density ice has been
determined for several values of ice density. The results obtained
are presented herein and are combined with information from several
sources to make possible a more complete evaluation of the thermal
conductivity of ice over the entire range of ice density. The investigation 
was conducted in a 3.84- by 10-inch tunnel at the NACA
Lewis laboratory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>METHOD, APPARATUS, AND PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The thermal conductivity of a substance is usually determined by
means of standard laboratory procedures and equipment. Few such determinations 
have been made for low-density ice, however; and since the
investigation reported in reference 2 supplied all the data necessary
for the determination of thermal conductivity, the computations were
made and are presented herein.  </p>
<p>The ice formations to be studied were formed on a section of the
upper surface of a flat-plate model which was mounted in the test section 
of the 3.84- by 10-inch tunnel. The ice which formed on the surface was 
then maintained at constant thickness (no net transfer of mass
by sublimation or condensation) while the heat-flow rate and the 
temperature were measured. The condition of constant ice thickness was
necessary for two reasons: (1) The stream-side surface temperature
could be readily obtained only for the condition for which the surface
temperature was equal to the temperature of saturation of the air stream,
and (2) the thermal conductivity must be determined for steady-state
conditions for a constant ice thickness.  </p>
<p>The flat-plate model (shown in fig. 1) was 18 inches long, 0.75
inch thick, and 3.84 inches wide and was made of wood to minimize heat
conduction through the model. One section of the upper surface of the
model consisted of a 3.84- by 5.75-inch copper plate 1/16 inch thick
set flush in the surface and located with its leading edge 4-7/16 inches
from the leading edge of the model. The copper plate was the upper surface 
of a multipass copper box through which cold alcohol could be
pumped. Five thermocouples were located in the surface of the copper
plate spaced at 1-1/8-inch intervals along the center line. The thermo-couple 
leads passed through tubes in the alcohol chamber, and the
thermocouple junctions were made flush with the outer plate surface.
The tubes were soldered to the copper plate and to the bottom of the
copper box. Additional thermocouples were located in the tunnel plenum
chamber to measure the total temperature of the air stream and in the
alcohol inlet and outlet lines to the copper box. A schematic diagram
of the alcohol and thermocouple system is included in figure 1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mass-transfer investigation reported in reference 2 placed certain 
restrictions on the method of forming the ice which were best met
by causing the water vapor in the humidity-controlled air stream to condense 
directly to the solid state on-the surface of the cold copper
plate. The plate was cooled to a temperature below that of the frost
point of the air stream by the flow of cold alcohol through the copper
box. The alcohol was cooled In an alcohol-dry ice bath heat exchanger.
The resultant ice formation thus took the form of a dense frost-like
formation as shown in figure 2. </p>

<p><img alt="Figure 2. Ice formation on the flat-plate model by condensation of water vapor from the air stream." src="images%2FNACA-TN-3143%2FFigure%202.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice formations were deposited on the
refrigerated surface of the copper plate at nearly constant values of
5000 feet pressure altitude and 45° F total temperature of the air stream
for Mach numbers of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. The thickness of the ice formation, 
which is dependent upon the humidity, velocity, and static pressure 
of the air stream, was controlled through regulation of the steam
supply used for humidification of the air stream. The ice was allowed
to form until a thickness of approximately 0.20 centimeter had been obtained. 
Measurements of the ice thickness while the tunnel was in operation 
were made through a window in the tunnel wall by the use of a
short-focal-length telescope mounted on a vernier carriage. The telescope 
was focused on the pointer (fig. 2) which was directly above the
center line of the copper plate. The depth of focus of the telescope
was less than 3/4 inch; therefore, with the pointer in focus the ice
surface viewed was within the range of approximately +/- 3/8 inch from the
center line. The mean height of the ice surface was used in order to
account for roughness projections and depressions.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>The density of the ice formed by the condensation of the vapor from
the air stream at constant values of total temperature and pressure
altitude varied as a function of the Mach number at which the ice was
formed, as shown in figure 3. Average values of the ice density for
three or more ice samples were determined for each Mach number.</p>

<p>Values of the thermal conductivity of ice (Btu/(hr)(sq ft)(°F/in.))
were obtained for ice formed at Mach numbers of 0.4 to 0.8 and are presented 
in figure 4 as a function of the density (obtained from fig. 3)
of the ice formation. The average temperature of the ice as determined
from the average of the stream-side ice-surface temperature and the
model-side plate-surface temperature was in the temperature range from
3° to -13° F. The values of thermal conductivity obtained showed no
consistent variation with temperature for the temperature range used in
this investigation. Included, in figure 4 are values obtained by several
investigators as reported in references 4 to 6 for solid glaze ice and
for packed snow. All the data points shown in figure 4 for densities
less than 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter are for packed snow except for
the results of the present investigation which are for ice formed by the
condensation method. </p>

The ranges of thermal conductivity of solid, glaze ice for temperatures 
from 0° to -90° C as given in reference 6 from computations of
van Dusen t s equations (k = 20.9 (1 - 0.0017t) milliwatt/(cm)(°C) and by
Jakob and Erk (ref. 6) are also presented. van Dusen shows a relatively
small increase in thermal-conductivity values with decrease in ice temperature, 
while the work of Jakob and Erk, which is more recent, shows
a considerably greater change with temperature. The equations of van
Dusen and Devaux for packed snow with a density near that of solid ice
show good agreement with all the results presented for solid ice except
for the low-temperature results of Jakob and Erk. The values of thermal
conductivity determined in the present investigation are, for the most
part, bounded by the van Dusen and Devaux curves. The spread in the data
is of the order of the error indicated by the analysis of the precision
of the measurements.  </p>
<p>The values of thermal conductivity of snow at densities of 0.45 and
0.5 gram per cubic centimeter, as taken from the International Critical
Tables from the results of Jansson and from Ingersoll and Zobel, appear
low when compared with the value Jansson reported at a density of 0.11
grain per cubic centimeter and the other data of figure 4. The data and
curves shown in figure 4 indicate that either the Devaux or the van
Dusen curves will probably give good approximation of the thermal conductivity 
of ice over the whole range of ice densities; it appears probable 
that the use of the van Dusen curve may result in values of thermal
conductivity which are too low for ice at very low temperatures.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Values of the thermal conductivity of low-density ice formed by a
condensation process on a cold surface have been determined. The data
show good agreement with the equations of van Thisen and Devaux for the
thermal conductivity of packed snow as a function of the snow density.</p>
