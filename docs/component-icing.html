<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We saw some details of the Lewis Rodert's work on the 
Lockheed 12A test aircraft in <a href="/engine-exhaust-heat.html">Engine Exhaust Heat</a>. 
However, wing ice protection was not the only challenge:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fly into ice clouds and survive,
the Ames group necessarily became expert on the impact
of ice on the total aircraft. 
"I am surprised to find", noted [NACA Langley] Engineer-in-Chief Smith DeFrance, 
"that there are so many details which have not been anticipated 
before the de-icing tests were started." 
Frosting prevented photographs out cabin windows; 
Clousing and McAvoy found they needed better instruction on flying blind; 
electrically-heated 
pitots looked clean even when ice in the throat skewed pressure readings; 
exhaust gas corroded the aluminum alloy at the wing tip; and the radio broke regularly.
Rodert persuaded United Airlines to install in the 12A a radio they had specially
adapted to ice flying. 
He asked the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to design electric-resistance heating
for the twenty-five foot-long antenna wire that stretched between the cabin and the tail.
And he asked the Naval Research Laboratory and the Air Corps labs at Wright Field to
design loop antennas that would not collect static as they encountered precipitation.
Any sharp corner or gadget protruding into the airstream,
Rodert constantly reminded manufacturers,
was an invitation both to icing and static electricity.</p>

<p>Safe flight in icing conditions requires design for 
"the impact of ice on the total aircraft", as noted above, 
not just the larger components that we have seen most of so far (wings and engines). </p>
<p>We previously looked at windshield ice protection. 
Here, we will look at NACA publications on two other airplane components, 
fuel vents and radomes.</p>
<h2>"Investigation of Aerodynamic and Icing Characteristics of Recessed Fuel-Vent Configurations", NACA-TN-1789 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></h2>
<p><em>"this location of the vents is in an area susceptible to icing"</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation has been conducted in the NACA Cleveland icing
research tunnel to determine the aerodynamic and icing characteristics 
of several recessed fuel-vent configurations. The vents were
investigated aerodynamically to obtain vent-tube pressures and pressure 
distributions on the ramp surface as functions of tunnel-air
velocity arid. angle of attack. Icing Investigations were made to
determine the vent-tube pressure losses for several icing conditions 
at tunnel-air velocities ranging from 220 to 440 feet per second.  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In a cloud-icing condition, roughness caused by ice formations
on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp, rather than icing
of the vent configuration, caused a rapid loss in vent-tube pressures 
during the first few minutes of an icing period. Only the
configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, a 7 ramp angle, and
a common plenum chamber maintained the required vent-tube pressures
throughout a 60-minute icing period, although the ice formations
on this configuration were more severe than those observed for the
other configurations. No complete closure of vent-tube openings
occurred for the configurations investigated.  </p>
<p>A simulated freezing-rain condition caused a greater and more
rapid vent-tube pressure loss than was observed for a cloud-icing
condition.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Note: a "fuel cell" below is a type of fuel tank or sub-tank, 
not an electricity generating technology.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction  </p>
<p>Several types of fuel cell now in use in transport airplanes
tend to collapse under negative pressure, venting in such a manner
that much of the contents is expelled. Overpumping during fuel
transfer between cells may also cause the fuel to be expelled
through the vents. The location of fuel-cell vents is very
important in the reduction of fire hazards because fuel expelled
from improperly located vents may seep into the wings or the
fuselage proper and thereby create a serious fire hazard.
The existence of a negative pressure in a fuel coil may be
eliminated by proper sealing of the fuel-cell compartment and by
venting the compartment to the upper wing surface while venting
the fuel cell to the lower surface. This solution, however, is
impractical for many existing fuel-cell installations because of
structural difficulties.<br>
In order to minimize the fire hazard, the vents can be
relocated from the fuselage and the nacelles to the lower surface of
the outer wing panels. Because this location of the vents is in an
area susceptible to icing, particularly during high angle-of-attack
attitudes, it was necessary to determine whether ice formations
would sufficiently impair the aerodynamic characteristics of the
vent to cause failure of the fuel cells.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Icing<br>
4. Rapid losses in vent-tube pressures during the first few
minutes in icing conditions were caused by the roughness of the ice
formations on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp rather
than by the icing of the vent configuration.<br>
5. In similar cloud-icing conditions, only the configuration
in which the highest vent-tube pressures were attained maintained
the required vent-tube pressure throughout a 60-minute icing period. 
In general, the configurations with diverging ramp walls
maintained adequate vent-tube pressures for a longer period of
time in an icing condition than configurations with parallel ramp
walls.<br>
6. For similar cloud-icing conditions, the ice formations on
the rear wall slope for configurations with diverging ramp walls
were more severe than those observed for configurations with parallel
walls. These more severe ice formations, however, did not appreciably 
influence the vent-tube pressures.<br>
7. At an angle of attack of 14Â° and at a tunnel-air velocity of
240 feet per second, no complete closure of vent-tube openings duo
to ice formations occurred for the configurations investigated,
although the areas of the vent-tube openings and the plenum-chamber
entrance were considerably reduced in some instances by ice formations.<br>
8. For simulated freezing-rain conditions, the vent-tube pressure 
losses for all configurations were greater and occurred more
rapidly than those observed for a cloud-icing condition. These large
and rapid vent-tube pressure losses were more detrimental at the
smaller angles of attack because the marginal pressure values were
reached in a matter of minutes.<br>
9. Negative vent-tube pressures were realized in some instances
for both cloud-icing and simulated freezing-rain conditions. For
the configuration having the highest vent-tube pressure characteristics, 
negative pressure values were obtained, only at low angles of
attack in a freezing-rain condition.  </p>

<h2>"Experimental Investigation of Radome Icing and Icing Protection", NACA-RM-E52J31 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h2>
<p><em>"At present very little is known of the effect of radome icing on radar operation."</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>An investigation has been conducted in the NACA Lewis icing research 
tunnel to determine the icing characteristics, the effects of icing on 
radar operation, and the protection requirements for two radome configurations. 
The radomes were for the F-89 airplane and were investigated at 
airspeeds up to 290 miles per hour, air total temperatures from 
-15Â° to +20Â° F, water contents up to 1.0 gram per cubic meter, and 
angles of attack of 0Â° and 4Â°. A fluid protection system using ethylene 
glycol was used for both anti-icing and de-icing.</p>
<p>The impingement of water and formation of ice on the radomes were 
found to agree well with theory and experience. The ice formations were 
found to produce serious effects on the radar performance. The fluid 
protection system gave adequate icing protection with anti-icing and 
de-icing requirements of practical magnitude.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In modern all-weather aircraft, radar has become of increasing 
importance in assuring successful performance of the airplane in all 
atmospheric and operational conditions. This is particularly true of 
military aircraft, where, in addition to its use as a landing and 
navigational aid, radar is used for bomb sighting, target tracking, and 
gunfire control. Successful operation of modern aircraft demands, 
therefore, unimpeded radar operation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At present very little is known of the effect of radome icing on 
radar operation. Theoretical calculations of the transmission of microwaves 
through ice can be made but are dependent upon the values assumed 
for the electrical properties of ice. Reference 1 indicates considerable 
variation in both the dielectric constant and conductivity for bulk ice 
produced in the laboratory. In addition, it is known that ice formations 
encountered in flight are considerably different in type and structure 
from bulk ice. Flight radome icing very probably would also differ in 
type and structure from ice produced on a radome in static conditions as 
in a cold chamber. It would appear, therefore, that neither calculations 
nor static tests will give realistic values of the effect of radome icing 
on radar performance.<br>
...<br>
Two radome configurations were tested, those for the F-89C and F-89D 
airplanes employing APG-33 and APG-40 radar, respectively. The radar is 
of the conical-scan type with a parabolic reflector-type antenna. The 
radar is mounted in the nose of the airplane; the radomes are bodies of 
revolution which fair into the nose of the fuselage. Sketches showing 
sectional views of the two radome configurations are presented in figure 1. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Sketch showing halfsections of test radomes and relative positions on the airplane.
" src="images%2FNACA-RM-E52J31%2FFigure%201.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The narrow C-radome is essentially parabolic in section having a 
nose radius of 6.955 inches. The blunt D-radome is almost hemispherical, 
with a nose radius twice that of the C-radome, or 13.91 inches. Figure 1 
also shows the location of the two radomes relative to a common reference 
plane on the airplane. Both radomes were of similar construction, 
consisting of molded Fiberglas impregnated with a synthetic resin; the 
nominal thickness of both radomes was 3/8 inch. The outer surfaces of 
the radomes were coated with Gayco, a rubber-like material, to resist 
erosion and abrasion.</p>
<p>The radar operates in the X--band (3.2 cm wavelength) with nominal 
frequencies of 9245 and 9375 megacycles for the C- and D-radomes, respectively. 
The operation of this type of radar can best be seen by reference 
to figures 2 and 3. The radar feed which projects ahead of the parabolic 
antenna directs the microwave signal towards the antenna, which reflects 
the electromagnetic beam forward. Since the feed is rectangular, a beam 
which is elliptical in cross section is obtained. The antenna nutates 
about a spin axis and is also set at an angle with respect to the spin 
axis as shown in figure 2. The radar beam is thus made to follow a 
wobble motion; the center of the beam describes the surface of a cone
in space. In addition, the antenna moves or scans with respect to the
radome axis in both the azimuth and elevation planes. Space limitations
restricted the scan angle to Â±30Â° and Â±35Â° on the C- and D-radomes,
respectively. Any object that falls within the beam during a nutation
of the antenna will return a series of echos that are amplitude-modulated   <br>
as the antenna rotates. The modulated signal can then be used to indicate 
the angular displacement of the line of sight from the antenna to 
the object relative to the radome axis.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The antenna and necessary electronic equipment together with the test 
radomes were mounted on a faired afterbody installed in the test section 
of the icing research tunnel. A view of the setup with the C-radome 
removed showing the antenna is shown in figure 3. </p>
<p>Droplet impingement and icing.<br>
The determination of the rate and 
location of the water-droplet impingement was accomplished by a tracer 
technique. Small amounts of a water-soluble dye (Azo Rubine) were placed 
in the icing-cloud spray water which was injected into the tunnel air 
stream ahead of the test section at air temperatures above freezing. 
Strips of an absorbent paper were wrapped around the radome surface upon 
which the water-dye solution impinged during the short (1 to 10 sec) 
exposure period. The liquid-water content of the cloud during these 
short exposures was obtained by exposing a narrow strip of the absorbent 
paper having a high and known collection efficiency. The quantity of dye
collected on the absorbent paper was determined by means of a spectrophotometer, 
which together with the known dye concentration in the spray 
cloud yielded the local rate of deposition of water on the radome and the
local collection efficiency. Impingement results were obtained for both 
the C- and D-radomes at airspeeds of approximately 175 and 290 miles per 
hour, angles of attack of 0Â° and 4Â°, liquid-water contents of 0.4 and 
1.14 grams per cubic meter, and mean effective droplet diameters of
9 to 14 microns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The photographs of figure 16 indicate that the main ice formation on the C-radome is confined to a rather
narrow region near the radome nose. These main formations extend rearward a distance of 6 to 8 inches 
and are followed by a very light frost-like formation that extends to the rear of the radome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transmission measurements were made during the 15-minute period in
which the radomes were iced. These results a represented in figure 18
for the two radomes at zero scan angle and zero angle of attack. A
theoretical curve has also been plotted for comparison with the experimental 
values. This theoretical curve was computed from the equations
of reference 4 for normal one-way transmission through a flat plate of
ice increasing in thickness at the rate of 2 inches per hour. A
dielectric constant for ice of 3.3 and a loss factor of 1.66x10-6
(defined as electrical conductivity of material divided by product of
frequency and dielectric constant) were assumed. All the experimental
curves tend to oscillate as does the theoretical curve; this effect is
more pronounced for the D- than for the C-radome.
This result should be
expected, since, as the ice thickness increases in multiples of the wavelength, 
alternate reinforcing and cancellation effects will occur as the
wave is reflected in its passage through the ice layer. </p>

100 % to about 60 %, with one case dropping to 20 %." src="images%2FNACA-RM-E52J31%2FFigure%2018.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Views of the spray cone and flow of fluid on the
radome surface produced by the T364M nozzle are shown in figure 23. The
two views of figure 23(a) and 23(b) show the spray cone with an excess
flow of fluid on the radome surface. The glycol flow rate is approximately
2 gallons per hour with no cloud-water spray. Reducing the flow
rate slightly produces the partially wetted surface of figure 23(e),
although the full spray cone is maintained. Further reductions in the
glycol flow rate result in less of the radome being wetted with the flow
in the form of streaks or rivulets. Eventually a point is reached at
which the spray cone breaks down, and the fluid flows back over the
nozzle and produces a very uneven distribution on the radome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 23. Views of glycol-water spray cone. T364M nozzle; nozzle a i r pressure,

<blockquote>
<p>The photographs of figure 24 show some typical results of anti-icing
on the D-radome with the T364M nozzle. In figure 24(a) insufficient
fluid is supplied and the ice is building up on the front of the radome.
Increasing the flow rate to 11 pounds per hour (fig.24(b)) eliminates
the ice at the radome nose, but large slush-like formations appear at
the rear of the radome. At a flow rate of 12.5 pounds per hour
(fig.24(c)), the radome is entirely free from ice, although runback
icing of a slush type occurs on the afterbody. Figures 24(c) and 24(d)
show the fluid and runback ice formations remaining on the afterbody
after the 34 minute test run. The large amounts of fluid and ice on
the afterbody indicate the possibility of obscuring the aircraft windshield 
with this type of system.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a component can still function without ice protection. 
For current aircraft, many fuel vents and radomes do not have ice protection. 
However, to have an all-weather aircraft, 
one must do the tests to show that the results in icing conditions are acceptable. </p>
<p>For weather radar, different frequencies have different effects than those in this study. 
The attenuation for ice on the radome may be tolerable. 
However, other effects, such as ice shedding from the radome 
and the aerodynamic effects on air data probes down stream need to be addressed.  </p>
<p>The FAA Aircraft Icing Handbook <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> recommends areas that may need ice protection. 
It does not list the numerous small components that might cause problems on some aircraft 
(but not others) if ice protection is not provided. 
"Any sharp corner or gadget protruding into the airstream" is not a bad description, 
although I might add gaps and holes to the list. 
It is up to you to show on your aircraft that they are not a problem. 
And I know that "discoveries" are still sometimes made about the 
adequacy of components for a particular aircraft on icing flight tests. </p>
