<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>During the war, more than a hundred cargo planes of the Air Transport Command, 
flying from bases in India over the Hump to battlefronts in China, crashed
in the Himalayas. Most of them were brought down by ice. In a single day in 1944,
nine of these big Army transports, loaded with sorely needed supplies for the Allies’
fighting forces, were lost.<br>
Many of the fatal crashes of commercial aviation have been traced to this same
cause. For years commercial transports have been equipped with anti-icing devices,
but the apparatus in common use was designed to assist in meeting an emergency
when it arises, not to prepare the plane for deliberate flight into ice clouds. 
If dangerous icing conditions are inadvertently encountered, transport pilots are instructed
to turn back or land at a safe alternate airport.<br>
“The greatest advance that can be made in air transport from its present level,”
said Edward P. Warner in 1946, “is not in speed, or even in economy, important as
that is, but in regularity. When cancellations on account of weather are eliminated,
or even reduced to a fifth or a tenth of their present number, air transport’s whole
status will be changed.” It is difficult to see how aviation can come into its full
destiny as an every-day competitor of steamships and railroads unless airplanes are
made capable of flying in any weather.</p>

<h2><a href="https://icinganalysis.github.io/design-manuals.html">Ice Protection Design Manuals</a></h2>
<p><em>"An aircraft engineer can use this report to design adequate ice protection systems for any type aircraft for any flight mission profile."</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>The knowledge of aircraft icing reached enough maturity to produce engineering design manuals.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions of the Ice Protection Thread</h2>
<p><em>"The optimum icing protection system for ... any particular aircraft cannot be generally specified; the choice of the optimum system is dependent upon the specific characteristics of the airplane and engine, the flight plan, the probable icing conditions, and the performance requirements of the aircraft."</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>There are many viable ice protection technologies and strategies to choose from.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<!--
p.528

"One useful job for the full-scale tunnel would be a study of the effect
of de-icers, both in their deflated and in their operating condition, on the drag
and the stalling characteristics of wings. Another would be an investigation of the
temperature drop of air flowing around a wing. Where moisture in the air forms as
ice on an aerodynamic surface, it is presumably the result of a change of temperature
on contact with that surface. If there is to be any possibility of using heat effectively
in the prevention of ice, data are needed on the exact conditions under which heat
ought to be used and the exact amount that ought to be applied. Even if heat is
considered out of the question, the investigation of temperature changes would still
be worthwhile as providing a basis for determining the probable locations of ready
ice deposit. Experience indicates that certain types of control surfaces, for example,
accumulate ice, while others do not. It suggests the need for particular care in the
design of slotted controls, the more especially as de-icers can hardly be used in a slot.
While of course much of this work can only be done in a refrigerated tunnel where
practical tests of actual ice deposit can be made, there is more that can be done in
any kind of a flowing stream if ice formation can be redefined in more general terms
as a thermodynamic problem.”
