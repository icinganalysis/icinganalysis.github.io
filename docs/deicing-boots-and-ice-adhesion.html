<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Pneumatic boot deicers were the first widely used form of 
aircraft ice protection, and are still used today.  </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deicing boots were developed independent of NACA.  </li>
<li>Oil coatings aid the shedding of ice.  </li>
<li>NACA development efforts largely shifted to thermal deicing in the 1940s.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020066162">"We Freeze to Please": A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety</a>, 
the “expanding rubber sheet” or “ice-removing overshoe”
for ice protection was developed independently of NACA in the 1930s, 
and was the first widely used method of aircraft ice protection. 
Small passages within the rubber could be periodically inflated to shed ice (typically once every two minutes). 
While some "inter-cycle" ice forms, the maximum amount of ice is limited, if all is working properly. 
The original version used rubber 
"Coated with a mixture of 4 parts pine, 4 parts diethylthalate, and 1 part castor oil". 
An oil coating improves the effective shedding of ice from the rubber surface, 
as on a bare rubber surface residual ice can persist and grow between deicing cycles.  </p>
<p>While the initial implementation of this method of ice protection showed promise, 
an accident in 1937 attributed to icing in flight prompted a call for improvements. </p>
<h2>Notes on spelling</h2>
<p>NACA-era sources tend to use the spelling "de-ice" or "de-icer", 
while more recently "deice" or "deicer" tends to be used. 
When quoting text from the NACA-era, I leave it as is.<br>
When discussing text of the NACA-era, I tend to use their spelling, 
but I may not be consistent.<br>
However, "anti-ice" should consistently include the hyphen. 
I am not going to mark every historic spelling variation with "sic". </p>
<p>I read somewhere that NACA was usually pronounced as the separate letters, 
"N A C A", rather than as a word, as NASA usually is. 
This explains why the article "an" is used, as in "an NACA 0011 airfoil". 
However, my aerospace colleagues in the late 1980s, 
including the senior ones, pronounced NACA as a word. </p>
<h2>NACA-TN-339 "Refrigerated Wind Tunnel Tests on Surface Coatings for Preventing Ice Formation" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>NACA had researched several coatings that can reduce ice adhesion, 
compared to bare rubber or metal
(See <a href="/naca-tn-339.html">NACA-TN-339, "Refrigerated Wind Tunnel Tests on Surface Coatings for Preventing Ice Formation"</a>).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insoluble compounds:<br>
- Light lubricating mineral oil.<br>
- Heavy lubricating mineral oil.<br>
- Cup grease.<br>
- Vaseline.<br>
- Paraffin.<br>
- Simonize wax.  </p>
<p>Soluble compounds:<br>
- Glycerine.<br>
- Glycerine and calcium chloride.<br>
- Molasses and calcium chloride.<br>
- Hardened sugar solution.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>However, none of the materials tested lowered ice adhesion enough to shed by 
aerodynamic forces alone. </p>

<h2>NACA-TN-723 "Adhesion of Ice in Its Relation to the De-icing of Airplanes" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The various possible means of preventing ice adhesion
on airplane surfaces are critically reviewed.
Results are presented of tests of the adhesive forces between ice and
various solid and liquid surfaces.  </p>
<p>It is concluded that the de-icing of airplane wings
by heat from the engine exhaust shows sufficient promise
to warrant full-scale tests.
For propellers, at least, and
possibly for certain small areas such as windshields, radio
masts, etc., the use of de-icing or adhesion-preventing
liquids will provide the best means of protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 1. Metal blocks held togther by ice for tensile strength tests. Figure 2. Failure of specimen in tension. Failure occured in ice and not at the ice-metal surface." src="images/NACA-TN-723/Figures 1 and 2.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSIONS<br>
The most important conclusions drawn from the present
tests are possibly not new, but they seem to be quite definite.<br>
1. Ice will adhere to any solid surface tried thus
far with a force greater than the cohesive forces within
the ice.<br>
2.Ice will not adhere to a surface provided that
there is a liquid interface between the ice and the surface.
If such a liquid interface is formed, the force
required to remove the ice will be little more than the
aerodynamic or aerostatic forces tending to hold the ice
to the surface.<br>
3. The outlook for preventing ice formation on the
surfaces of an airplane wing by means of some liquid surface 
is not encouraging. The amount of liquid required
will probably be large and some mechanical force is necessary 
to overcome the air forces in order to remove the
ice. The use of such liquids for windshield de-icing or
for small surfaces may be successful.<br>
4. For propellers, where a centrifugal force is always available, 
the use of liquids for de-icing will probably continue 
to be the most efficient method.<br>
5. Although wind tunnel tests have indicated that
heating the wings of an airplane as a means of preventing
ice formation is feasible, no full-scale tests have been
made to determine the practicability of the method.
It is believed that such tests should be conducted as soon
as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reflects a major NACA effort for the next several years, 
to develop thermal ice protection systems and conduct full scale flight tests.</p>
<h2>NACA-ACR-A-53 <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h2>
<p>A Lockheed 12A was modified by NACA for flight in icing. 
This included a pneumatic boot on the horizontal stabilizer. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ice removal was only partially successful on the horizontal 
stabilizer on which the inflatable de-icer had
been installed.
It was observed that if the ice formation was hard and 
confined to the leading-edge region,
upon inflation of the lobes of the de-icer the ice would
break into many pieces and blow away.
However, if the
ice extended rearward over the surface or was inclined to
have a soft consistency, the inflation of the lobes would
break the ice only slightly and much of the ice would remain 
on the wing leading edge.
Figures 25 and 26 show
the ice accretion remaining on the leading edge of the
stabilizer after the inflatable de-icer had been operated
during one flight. </p>

<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The following results were obtained from an icing investigation
conducted in the NACA Lewis icing research tunnel using a 
thermal-pneumatic de-icer mounted on a 42-inch-chord NACA 0018 airfoil.<br>
1. Excessive ice formation was prevented on the inflatable areas
when the pneumatic tubes were operated on a 2-minute inflation cycle
with continuous electric heating at the leading edge.
2. During nonicing conditions the installation of the de-icer with
no tubes inflated resulted in a drag increase approximately 140 percent
greater than that of the bare airfoil. This value increased to a
maximum of approximately 620 percent with tube inflation.
3. With complete icing protection on the leading-edge thermal
section of the de-icer and with the tubes operating on a-2-minute
Inflation cycle, drag measurements indicated that scattered residual
ice formations on the pneumatic section after an Inflation cycle
produced drag losses approximately equal to the drag incurred by Ice
that formed during the remainder of the cycle.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br>
The results of a study to determine the effects of pneumatic de-icers 
and ice formations on aerodynamic characteristics of an NACA 0011
airfoil may be summarized as follows:<br>
1. Boot inflation removes the main part of an ice formation. Ice
remaining after inflation of a spanwise-tube de-icer increased airfoil
section drag 7 to 37 percent for the following conditions: angles of
attack from 0° to 4.6°) airspeeds of 175 and 275 mph) glaze- and rime-icing 
conditions) air total temperatures from 0 F to 30 F) liquid-water
contents from 0.3 to 1.0 gram per cubic meter) and cycle times from 1 to
4 minutes. For these conditions the drag increase depended primarily on
chordwise extent of residual ice. In heavy glaze-icing conditions (1.0
g/cu m liquid-water content and 25 F air total temperature) at high
angles of attack (4.6° to 9.3°) ice remaining after inflation increased
airfoil drag 15 to 100 percent. For a given operating condi tion) the
drag increase due to residual ice usually was constant regardless of the
number of de-icing cycles. Minimum airfoil drag in icing (averaged over
a de-icing cycle) was usually obtained with a short (about 1 min) de-icing cycle. 
Alternate tube inflation of the spanwise de-icer in dry
air increased airfoil section drag 100 to 165 percent and decreased lift
6 to 10 percent . Averaged over a 1-minute cycle) the drag increase with
alternate inflation in dry air varied from 10 to 16 percent. Simultaneous 
tube inflation reduced the 10-percent increase to 3.2 percent.<br>
2. Ice-removal characteristics of a chordwise-tube de-icer were the
same as for the spanwise-tube de-icer. Minimum airfoil drag in icing
using the chordwise de-icer was always obtained with a short (1 min) de-icing cycle. 
Inflation of the chordwise de-icer in dry air increased
section drag only 5 percent) had no effect on lift) and had negligible
effect on airfoil drag averaged over a cycle.<br>
3. With the de-icer inoperative, rime-ice formations of 0.5 pound
per foot span increased section drag 38 to 67 percent and decreased lift
up to 4 percent for angles of attack from 0° to 4.6°. The same amount 
of ridge-type glaze ice increased drag 124 to 230 percent and decreased
lift up to 20 percent for angles of attack from 0° to 9.3°. Increasing
the airfoil angle of attack with even a small ice formation on the airfoil 
can cause large increases in drag and losses in lift. Spanwise
spoilers mounted at various chordwise positions were used to help determine 
the effect of size and location of ridge-type ice on airfoil drag.
Such drag was found to vary almost directly with spoiler height and the
local air velocity over the bare airfoil.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Pneumatic deicing boots are still used today on many aircraft. 
More recent implementations use synthetic elastomers rather than natural rubber, 
and a variety of coatings to limit ice adhesion. 
However, for higher airspeed aircraft such as jets, 
rain and dust erosion are challenges to the durability of the 
elastomer surface, and other forms of ice protection are more common.  </p>
