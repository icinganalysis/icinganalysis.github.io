<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Trajectories of water droplets moving in the ideal two-dimensional
flow field ahead of a body of rectangular cross section and infinite extent

<p>So, we will devote this review to the title that we have not yet seen, NACA-TN-3658.</p>
<p>Why would anyone studying aircraft icing care about impingement on a ribbon or rectangle? 
They seem to be a rather non-aerodynamic surfaces. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the general body shapes of interest is that of a
rectangular body having a flat surface facing the airstream. Such a body
may be used as an approximation to the shape of the sensing elements of
certain instruments used to measure icing-cloud properties.  </p>
<p>Cloud-droplet size and size distribution are sometimes measured by
collecting samples of cloud droplets on small transparent slides coated
with oil or some water-sensitive substance (refs. 6 to 8). The slides
are then photographed to obtain a record of the droplet size distribution.
Various types of sampling devices have been used in which the collecting
element is usually a flat surface perpendicular to the airstream. The
evaluation of the cloud-droplet size distribution from samples obtained
in this way requires a knowledge of the relation between droplet diameter
and collection efficiency. Droplet-impingement data applicable to a body
of rectangular cross section would also be useful in estimating the collection efficiency of the central portion of the rotating-disk icing-rate
meter (refs. 7 to 9) and the rectangular bars used to measure the spray
distribution in an icing wind tunnel (ref. 10).</p>

<h3>Comparisons to the ribbon analysis from <a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Trajectory calculations based on ideal two-dimensional flow about a
ribbon (ref. 11), which is essentially a rectangle of zero chord, have
been used as an approximation to obtain the impingement on rectangular
bodies of finite chord. However, the ideal flow field ahead of a ribbon
is not a very satisfactory representation of the actual flow field in
front of a rectangular body because of the dependence of the flow ahead
of the body on conditions existing behind the body.<br>
The ideal flow field about a ribbon is symmetrical fore and aft, as
shown in figure 1(a), with the streamlines closing in directly behind the
body. In the case of real flow about a rectangular body, on the other
hand, the streamlines cannot be calculated exactly; but general knowledge
of the flow about solid boundaries suggests that the flow field is something 
like that shown schematically in figure 1(b). Flow separation occurs at the 
edge, and a wake is formed extending downstream. The effect
of variations in the ratio of chord to thickness cannot be estimated 
accurately, but is probably small, since the wake is roughly equivalent to
an indefinite downstream extension of the body.<br>
Potential flow exists outside the limits of the boundary layer and
wake (shown approximately by the dashed line). Figure 1(c) shows the
ideal-flow streamlines around a rectangular half body (a body of infinite
extent downstream). This flow field resembles the estimated real flow in
figure 1(b) much more closely than does the ideal flow about a ribbon
(fig. 1(a)). The effect of the downstream extent of the body on the flow
field ahead is shown in figure 1(d), which is a superposition of portions
of the fields shown in figures 1(a) and (c). The comparison shows that
the presence of the afterbody exerts a considerable influence on the flow
field ahead of the body.<br>
The ideal flow field of the rectangular half body represents a closer
approximation to real flow than does the ideal flow about a ribbon; however, 
it too is subject to the disadvantage that the velocity becomes infinite 
at the corner. In spite of this disadvantage, the ideal flow field
in front of the rectangular half body was used, in the calculation of 
trajectories, because It was considered to be sufficiently realistic to yield
approximate results of practical value and because the velocity components
could be calculated without too much difficulty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Differential Equations of Droplet Motion<br>
The differential equations that describe the motion of the droplets
were obtained by equating the drag force with the rate of change of momentum 
of the droplet (ref. 4). The equations are expressed in dimensionless 
form in order to maintain the number of calculations at a minimum
and to simplify the presentation of the results. They apply to the motion 
of droplets in a plane perpendicular to the edges of the rectangular
half body in the system of rectangular coordinates shown in figure 2.</p>

<p>Values of n, Î²0 and E calculated from the empirical equations
are presented in figures 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The 74 values of
YO obtained with the differential analyzer and the corresponding values
calculated from the equations are presented for comparison in table II.
The standard deviation of the differences between corresponding values
is 0.0051; therefore, the probable error involved in using the equations
to determine y0 is Â±0.0034 based on the assumption that the results from
the trajectories are absolutely correct. The dimensionless parameters
Re0 and K are defined in equations (3) and (4). Equations and graphs
for use in determining values of K and Re_0 in terms of air speed, altitude, 
body size, and droplet diameter in practical units are presented
in reference 13.</p>

<p>In the end, the difference between the ribbon and the semi-infinite rectangle are small.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was pointed out in the discussion of flow fields in the INTRODUCTION 
that the flow field of the rectangular half body differs from that
of the ribbon by the addition of an afterbody, but that both differ from
the real flow about a rectangular body because of the absence of flow
separation and because of the requirement of infinite velocity at the
edges. An examination of the comparative streamlines in figure 1(d) shows
a great difference in velocity in the immediate vicinity of the edge.
(Velocity is inversely proportional to streamline spacing.) In spite of
the difference in the flow fields, however, the differences in collection
efficiency of the ribbon and rectangle are only moderate. The maximum 
difference in table III is 0.099 at K = 2 and Ï† = 10,000, and the
average difference for all values in table III is 0.026. These facts
suggest that-the results obtained using the ideal flow ahead of the rectangular 
half body are likely to be a fairly good approximation to the
actual impingement on a rectangular body in real flow. The largest difference 
between the ideal flow and the real flow is that the ideal flow
permits a high local air velocity in the neighborhood of the edge; however, 
these differences in local air velocity in the neighborhood of the
edge have a relatively small effect on the trajectories.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUDING REMARKS<br>
The rate and distribution of water impingement on a semi-infinite
rectangular body moving in a cloud of uniform liquid-water content and
droplet size have been determined by means of droplet trajectory calculations. 
Empirical equations have been found providing an approximate representation 
of the impingement rate and distribution in terms of the
inertia parameter K and the free-stream droplet Reynolds number Re_0
Equation (17) gives the local impingement efficiency 13 as a function of
distance from the centerline of the rectangle in terms of the following
three parameters: (1) the collection efficiency E, (2) the impingement
efficiency at the centerline Î²0, and (3) the impingement distribution
index n.<br>
These parameters may be determined from K and Re_0 by means of
empirical equations (19), (20), and (21).  </p>
