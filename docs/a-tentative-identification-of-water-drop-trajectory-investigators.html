<p><img alt="Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904. Water-drop-trajectory analog.
Two investigators operate a large mechanical computer. 
One is seated turning a crank attached to a large cylinder labelled &quot;Input Chart&quot;. 
The second operator turns another input chart crank. 
Another cylinder is labelled &quot;Droplet Trajectories&quot;. 
There are many shafts and gears visible in the machine. 
Some machine parts are labelled with the differential equations of motion being solved.

<em>Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904</em>  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While no one is identified in Figure 15 of NACA-TN-2904, 
I speculate that these investigators are 
Helen M. Gallagher, and Dorothea E. Vogt. 
(I do not know which name goes with which individual). 
While neither Gallager nor Vogt is credited in NACA-TN-2904, 
it is possible that they contributed to the analysis, 
as they did in several other water-drop trajectory publications. </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Yes, I have used this figure a lot, as it is one of the best of the hundreds I have viewed from the NACA-era. 
This image is also notable in that of the hundreds of NACA-era documents that I have read, 
this is the only one where the people appear to be women. </p>
<p>I have not been able to find photos of Gallager or Vogt for comparison
(and photos of any NACA-era authors are hard to find). 
In this photo the individuals are not at good angles for identification anyway. </p>
<p>Women investigators were sometimes named as co-authors of publications. 
From NASA SP-4306, "Engines and Innovations" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> [emphasis added]:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate of icing on a given surface or shape of a component could then be predicted. 
The Lewis group extended the available data over a range of airfoil shapes and thicknesses 
through the use of a differential analyzer. Harry Mergler of the Instrument and 
Computing Division adapted this early computer designed at MIT by Vannevar Bush to
meet the needs of icing research. Although calculating the trajectory of a droplet was still a
laborious process, the differential analyzer reduced the time it took for a single calculation from
weeks to about four days. <strong>Women who had formerly worked the problems on simple mechanical
calculators made the transition to the gargantuan differential analyzer with comparative ease.
Often they were given the distinction of having their names appear as co-authors of the reports
of these studies, no doubt because their contribution went beyond the sheer drudgery of "number
crunching."</strong> In addition to reducing the time for arduous calculations, the differential analyzer
was a potential teacher of higher mathematics. The calculus unfolded mechanically through the
gearing and shafts; the chart recorders taught the operators "to grasp the innate meaning of the
differential equation." The machine trained them to think in the same logical steps that the
machine ground through in making a calculation. <strong>Through the back door, women assigned to toil
on this giant calculator gained access to the abstruse realm of partial differential equations- a
realm in which not all engineers hired during World War II were comfortable.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rationale for the identification is that Gallager or Vogt collaborated on other publications with Rinaldo Brun as lead author. 
The publications are before and after NACA-TN-2904.  </p>
<p>Selected publications with Brun as lead author:  </p>

<p>I have not found biographies of either investigator. 
Here are listings from worldcat.org of their publications 
(the listings on ntrs.nasa.gov are incomplete for these authors). </p>

<h2>Update</h2>
<p>A relative of Hellen Gallagher confirmed that the woman on the left is her. </p>
<p>S. from Ohio emailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woman on the left is Helen Marie Gallagher (Madden), my Mom. I believe they were doing research for what would become the F-14 fighter.<br>
I found your site while doing a Google search for her - it was a nice surprise to see this photo and your recognition of her and her coworkers. Thank you!<br>
She met my Dad while working at NACA - they got married in 1954. They had eight children together, seven boys and one girl. Helen Marie was an awesome Mom and person.<br>
Thanks again for recognizing her.</p>
