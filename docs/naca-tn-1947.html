<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An experimental investigation has been conducted to determine
the orifice coefficient of a jet directed perpendicularly to an air
stream as a function of pressure ratio and jet Reynolds number for
circular, square, and elliptical orifices. The effect of air-stream
velocity on the jet flow was also determined for three tunnel-air
velocities. Equations for the flow coefficients In terms of jet
Reynolds number and pressure ratio were obtained for the various
shapes. Excellent correlation was obtained between the results
for a jet discharging into still air and the results for a jet
discharging into a moving air stream, provided that the correct
outlet pressure was used.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTRODUCTION
The introduction of a gas or a vapor into an air stream for
purposes of heating or cooling the air stream may be easily 
accomplished by the use of a high-velocity jet directed perpendicularly
to the air stream, as reported in reference 1. In order to evaluate
the heating or cooling effect of such a jet, knowledge of the mass
air flow of the jet or, more fundamentally, the discharge coefficient 
of the orifice from which the jet is issuing is essential. 
In addition to the effects of jet Reynolds number and orifice shape
on the discharge coefficient, the jet pressure ratio and the interaction 
of the air stream and the jet must be considered.  </p>
<p>An investigation to determine the orifice-discharge coefficient
of a high-velocity air jet directed perpendicularly to an air stream
was undertaken in a 2- by 20-inch duct tunnel at the NACA Lewis
laboratory. The discharge coefficients of circular, square, and
elliptical orifices were determined at tunnel-air velocities of
160, 275, and 380 feet per second for several jet (orifice) areas,
a range of pressure ratios from 1.15 to 3.2, and a jet total 
temperature of approximately 400 F.</p>
<p>Flow coefficients in still air</p>
<p>The nine 1/16-inch-thick
of three circles, two
thin-plate orifices investigate
ellipses with an axis ratio of 4:1 1 two ellipses with an axis
ratio of 2:1, and two squares. The circular orifices had diameters
of 0.375, 0.500, and 0.625 inch;, the ellipses and squares had areas
equivalent to the 0.375- and 0.625-inch-diameter circles. Each
orifice was investigated over a range of pressure ratios from 1.15 to
3.2 and for jet total temperatures of approximately 70 0 and 4000 F.
Air for the jets was obtained by passing high-pressure air through
an electric heater and into a plenum chamber, the upper wall of
which contained the orifice, as shown in figure 1. The mass flow
was measured by a calibrated orifice in the ducting upstream of the
heater. The calibration curve for the measuring orifice indicated
an over-all accuracy of 2 percent.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plenum chamber was constructed with an inside diameter of
6 inches to minimize the effect of approach velocity and to insure
that the static temperature and pressure measured in the plenum
chamber would be equal to the total temperature and pressure of the
jet at the vena contracta.  </p>
<p>Static pressures were measured at the orifice and at a point
upstream of the orifice by pressure taps in the tunnel walls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>A cross plot of all the circular-orifice data is shown in
figure 4 where the flow coefficient is plotted as a function of jet
Reynolds number ρj Vj Dj / μj for constant Values of pressure ratio. 
The curves obtained are similar to those normally given for 
orifice-discharge coefficients at pressure ratios near 1. 
The flow coefficient decreased with increasing jet Reynolds number.  </p>

constant Reynolds number of 400,000 for circular orifices." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1947%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cross plot of the data in figure 4 showed that at a constant
Reynolds number two straight lines almost exactly represented the
variation of flow coefficient with pressure ratio (fig. 5).
These flow-coefficient relations at constant Reynolds number
were utilized as a parameter θ. From a replot of the data in
figure 4 as the variation of flow parameter C/θ with Reynolds
number, a single curve was obtained (fig. 6). An equation for this
curve has been obtained; It should be noted, however, that represents 
two functions that are valid only in their defined limits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Effect of tunnel-air velocity on jet flow</p>
<p>For the initial
study of the interaction of the jet and the air stream, the static
pressure into which the jet was discharging was assumed equal to
the free-stream static pressure of the air stream. The variation
of flow coefficient with pressure ratio is shown in figure 13 for a
0.625-inch-diameter circular orifice at a jet total temperature of
4000 F and at tunnel-air velocities of 0, 160, 275, and 380 feet
per second. Because the curves were separated by a function that
was dependent on the free-stream velocity and because of the relation 
of static pressure to velocity (Bernoulli's equation), a further 
investigation of the static pressure into which the jet was
discharging was undertaken.  </p>

uncorrected pressure ratio for 0.625-inch circular orifice at
several tunnel-air velocities. Jet total temperature, 400 F." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-1947%2FFigure%2013.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Measurements were made of the static pressure immediately
adjacent to the jet at the point of maximum thickness by a tap
located in the tunnel 0.030 inch from the orifice. These data indicated 
a static pressure considerably lower than free stream and
somewhat lower than that indicated by a static tap located on the
tunnel wall at the same longitudinal position. Analysis of these
data showed that the free-stream static pressure was related to the
outlet static pressure in accordance with the Bernoulli and mass-flow 
equations, provided that the free area at the orifice was based
on the tunnel width minus the jet width at the point of maximum
thickness. When the data of figure 13 were replotted using the
corrected values of flow coefficient and pressure ratio based on the
corrected outlet pressure, data were obtained (fig. 14) that were in
excellent agreement with the calculated curve for a jet discharging
into still air. When this correction was applied to all the data
for circular, square, and elliptical orifices, excellent agreement
was obtained with the results for a jet discharging into still air.
Calculation of the flow coefficient for a jet discharging into an
air stream is thus possible when the equations for a jet discharging
into still air are employed, provided that the correct outlet pressure 
is used.  </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SUMMARY OF RESULTS  </p>
<p>The following results were obtained In the investigation of
the flow coefficients of circular, square, and elliptical orifices
discharging into both a still and a moving air stream.<br>
1. Equations were obtained for the flow coefficients for the
various shapes in terms of pressure ratio and Jet Reynolds number.<br>
2. Agreement was obtained between the experimental results for
three-dimensional flow with circular orifices and the theoretical
results for two-dimensional flow.
3. The flow coefficient increased linearly with increasing
pressure ratio for pressure ratios up to choking. A transition
region was obtained at pressure ratios slightly higher than
choking and the flow-coefficient variation again became linear with
pressure ratio for the high values of pressure ratio.
4. The flow coefficient Increased more rapidly at the low
pressure ratios than at high pressure ratios.
5. The flow coefficient decreased with Increasing jet Reynolds
number at constant pressure ratios.
6. For a particular value of pressure ratio and jet total
temperature, the ellipses yielded the highest flow coefficients.
7. No effect of stream velocity on flow coefficient was
obtained, provided that the proper outlet static pressure was
utilized.</p>
