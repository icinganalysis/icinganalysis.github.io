<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Water-drop impingement on several bodies of revolution is quantified.  </p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>NACA-TN-4092 <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The impingement characteristics of bodies of revolution are of interest because such
bodies are representative of many aircraft components subject to icing
such as radomes, body noses, engine accessory housings, and the large
spinners of turboprop engines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-3099 <sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is the first in a series and has a rather complete description of the analysis methods, 
so the discussion below refers to that, unless noted otherwise. </p>
<h3>Flow field</h3>
<p>Potential flow can be determined in 2D radial coordinates as well as 2D Cartesian coordinates. 
This was used to assess several geometries. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The air velocity components for incompressible nonviscous flow
about a prolate ellipsoid of revolution are obtained from the exact
solution of Laplace's equation In prolate-elliptic coordinates (fig. 2) 
given by Lamb (ref. 3).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Impingement</h3>
<p>Water-drop trajectories could then be calculated. 
Results were presented in several forms. 
Dimensionless parameters similar to the in 
<a href="/mathematical-investigation-of-water-droplet-trajectories.html">Mathematical Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories</a> 
were used to concisely summarize a wide range of results. </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 4.png" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-3099%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<p><img alt="Figure 6.png" src="/images%2FNACA-TN-3099%2FFigure%206.png"></p>
<p>While results were presented over a wide range of conditions, 
for some cases the range may not be enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scale factors used in the differential analyzer to solve the
equations for the range of conditions presented in figures 5 to 10 and
the near-parallelism of the trajectories to the surface at large values
of 1/K made it impossible to obtain sufficient accuracy to present
detailed data, such as the rate of local impingement of water, at points
along the surface of the ellipsoid, for values of 1/K &gt; 90 for Re_0 = 0
and 1/K &gt; 30 for Re_0 &gt; 128. From Table I, it can be seen that, for
bodies as large as the fuselage of cargo or passenger airplanes, these
conditions are not uncommon. Examination of figures 5 and 10 shows,
however, that the extent (usually Sm &lt; 0.03) and rate of local impingement 
are small in this Re_0 and K region. Therefore, in this region
a knowledge of the extent of the impingement zone and the total rate of
impingement of water as calculated from the data of figures 8 and 6,
respectively, is sufficient for most applications.</p>

<p><img alt="Table I. Relation of dimensionless parameters to body size and atmospheric and flight conditions." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-3099%2FTable%20I.png">  </p>
<p>Drop size distributions could be considered. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, consider the cloud
droplet-size distribution shown in figure 11. Suppose that the volume-
median droplet size is 20 microns, the velocity is 200 miles per hour,
the ellipsoid length is 10 feet, the pressure altitude is 5000 feet, and
the temperature is 20 F. For these conditions, the value of Re_0,med
is 117.6 and of Kmed is 0.03898. The values of Re 0 and K corresponding 
to other droplet sizes in the distribution are obtained by
multiplying Re_O med by d/dmed and Kmed by (d/dmed)^2 and are used
to obtain r0^2,tan (fig. 6) for each droplet size. The values of
r0^2,tan for this example are plotted as a function of cumulative volume
in percent in figure 12. Integration of this curve gives a weighted
value of r0^2,tan 
equal to 0.000425; whereas, the value based on the
volume-median droplet size is 0.00031 (fig. 6).  </p>

<p>Some results may be applied for similar, but not identical, bodies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some
cases, where the body is of different shape, it may be possible to match
its nose section physically with the nose section of an ellipsoid (fineness 
ratio, 5) of selected length. If, in such a case, the contribution
of the afterbody to the air-flow field in the vicinity of the nose of
the body is small (as it often is), then the impingement data for the
matching portion of the surface of the ellipsoid can be used for determining 
the impingement characteristics of the nose region of the body.
In other cases, where the body shape differs from that of an ellipsoid
but the fineness ratio is the same, the air-flow field may be similar
enough that an estimate of the total catch can be obtained from the
ellipsoid data. In this case, no details of the surface distribution
of impinging water could be obtained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NACA-TN-3147 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> repeated a similar study for an ellipsoid of fineness ratio 10. 
Results were compared with those for a fineness ratio of 5 from NACA-TN-3099. 
By these parameters, the results appear to be similar. 
However, note that K is based on ellipsoid length, not diameter, 
so for the same diameter at the same conditions the K values will differ by a factor of 2 
for the different ellipsoids. </p>

<p>Some bodies were rotated at up to 1200 rpm, but it was noted:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although in some cases there are slight indications of an increase in impingement efficiency with rotation, 
in general the effect of rotation appeared to be negligible up to 1200 rpm.</p>

for ellipsoid of fineness ratio of 3.0 at four droplet diameters and zero angle of attack." src="/images%2FNACA-TN-4092%2FFigure%2011.png">  </p>
<p>The effects of angle of attack were also measured (not detailed herein).  </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>From NACA-TN-4092:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, the experimental data show that the local and total
impingement rates and impingement limits of bodies of revolution are primarily 
functions of the modified inertia parameters, the body shape, and
fineness ratio. Both the local impingement rate and impingement limits
depend upon the angle of attack. Rotation of the bodies had a negligible
effect on the impingement characteristics except for an averaging effect
at angle of attack. For comparable diameters the bluffer bodies had the
largest total impingement efficiency, but the finer and sharper bodies
had the largest values of maximum local impingement efficiency and, in
most cases, the largest limits of impingement. In most cases, the impingement 
characteristics were less than those calculated from theoretical
trajectories; in general, however, fairly good agreement was obtained 
between the experimental and theoretical impingement characteristics.</p>
