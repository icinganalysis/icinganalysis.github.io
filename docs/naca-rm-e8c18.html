<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A flight investigation is being conducted. in natural icing conditions 
to determine the effect of ice formations on the performance
of an axial-flow turbojet engine. One flight was made in icing conditions 
in which the icing rate varied from 5.1 to 2.1 inches per hour.
During a period of 45 minutes in icing, the tail-pipe temperature
increased from 761° to 1065° F and the jet thrust decreased from 1234
to 910 pounds. Ice penetrated to the second-stage stator blades.
No general conclusions can be reached from these data because
the icing condition was relatively light.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As this publication is brief (18 pages, with 12 of those photos or blank), 
it is reproduced nearly in its entirety herein.  </p>
<p>The jet engine inlet in this case did not have ice protection.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation in natural icing conditions is being conducted 
at the NACA Cleveland laboratory to determine the effect of
ice formation on the performance of an axial-flow turbojet engine.
Data presented were obtained during one flight at an engine speed
of 9000 rpm. This engine speed was chosen because of the low-operating 
tail-pipe temperature. Additional data are being obtained
at higher engine speeds and other icing conditions.  </p>
<p>APPARATUS  </p>
<p>The 24C-2 turbojet engine was mounted on a four-engine bomber,
which was provided with anti-icing equipment for the wings, the tail
surfaces, and the propellers. A general view of the installation is
shown in figure 1. A close-up view of the engine installation is
shown in figure 2. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The turbojet engine used for this investigation
has a 10-stage axial-flow compressor, a two-stage turbine, and an
annular combustion chamber. The operating characteristics of the
engine are as follows:  </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Maximum engine speed, rpm ..........12,000
Cruising engine speed, rpm .........11,000
Static-thrust rating, pounds .........2800
Maximum tail-pipe temperature, °F ....1220
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Instrumentation was provided at the compressor outlet for calculation 
of compressor efficiency and at the tail-pipe outlet for
calculations of air flow and thrust. Interstage static pressures
were provided to determine the pressure distribution through the
10-stage compressor.  </p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>Photographs taken after the icing flight are shown in figure 3.
A front view of the ice formation on the engine inlet and the starter
housing is shown in figure 3(a). The degree of ice accumulation on
the engine inlet is indicated in figure 3(b). Ice accumulation on
the inlet guide vanes is shown in figure 3(c). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Visual inspection
of the inlet indicated that ice had accumulated on the first-stage
stator blades (fig. 3(c)), the second-stage stator blades, and the
first-stage rotor blades. The ice formation on the first-stage
rotor blades was concentrated at the leading edge and was approximately 
1/8 inch thick. The ice formation on the second-stage stator
blades was also concentrated at the leading edge and was approximately 
1/32 inch thick and rather sporadic.  </p>
<p>Inspection of the compressor rotor and stator blades revealed
no damage to either from ice throw-off.  </p>
<p>The effect of the ice formation on the engine thrust and tail-pipe 
temperature is shown in figure 4 as a function of time in the
icing condition. </p>

thrust and tail-pipe temperature at engine speed of 9000 rpm." src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E8C18%2FFigure%204.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine was operated at a speed of 9000 rpm in
an icing condition for approximately 1 hour. Engine data were
taken before the icing cloud was entered and periodically during
the encounter with the icing condition. At the end of 45 minutes,
the engine thrust had decreased from 1234 to 910 pounds, a reduction
of approximately 26 percent. After 45 minutes, the tail-pipe temperature 
had reached its maximum rise from 761° to 1065° F. At
this point during the encounter, the tail-pipe temperature appeared
to stabilize. The greatest decrease in thrust and increase in
tail-pipe temperature appeared to occur in the first 15 minutes
of the encounter.  </p>
<p>A time history of the icing conditions encountered is given in
figure 5, which shows the rate of icing, free-air temperature, drop
size, and liquid-water content.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 5. Time history of icing condition encountered." src="/images%2FNACA-RM-E8C18%2FFigure%205.png">  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The icing rate varied from 5.1 to
2.1 inches per hour. The free-air temperature and the drop size
showed a gradual increase during the encounter. The liquid-water
content was highest during the first 15 minutes, reaching a peak
value of 0.38 gram per cubic meter and decreasing to approximately
0.17 gram per cubic meter during the remaining 45 minutes.
No general conclusions can be reached from these data because
the icing conditions were relatively light and occurred at an
average free-stream temperature only about 10° below the freezing
point. The conduction of heat through the engine parts and the
impact temperature rise on the rotor blades resulted in elevated
blade-surface temperatures and minimized the effect of icing on
engine performance. It is believed that at lower free-stream temperatures 
the effect on engine performance would be more severe.
These data were obtained at an engine speed of 9000 rpm and no
engine shutdown was required. If the engine had been operated at
a speed of 12,000 rpm, however, a reduction in engine speed would
have been mandatory.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following results were obtained with an axial-flow turbojet 
engine from one icing encounter in natural icing conditions
with an icing rate that varied from 5.1 to 2.1 inches per hour:<br>
1. The tail-pipe temperature increased from 761° to 1065° F
during an icing period of 45 minutes.<br>
2. The engine jet thrust decreased from 1234 to 910 pounds
during this same period.<br>
3. Ice formations penetrated to the second-stage rotor blades.  </p>
