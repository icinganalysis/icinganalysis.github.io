<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction<br>
In order to establish a rational basis for the efficient design of thermal
ice-prevention systems for airplanes the
Ames Aeronautical
Laboratory
of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
has undertaken experimental
investigation of the meteorological conditions conducive
to the formation of ice on aircraft.
A C-46 airplane has been equipped to measure
free-water, air temperature,
and drop size in clouds:
The
results of the free-water and air temperature
measurements made in the 1942-43 season 
have been reported in reference 1 <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.<br>
The principal physical factors determining icing conditions are 
temperature, liquid water concentration,
and drop-size. The meteorological conditions of icing involve the
distribution of these three physical variables within clouds and 
precipitation of various types in various synoptic weather situations. 
This report presents results of observations of the distribution of liquid 
water concentration and drop size in winter stratus clouds in the absence 
of significant frontal or cyclonic activity. The observations were mace near 
Minneapolis, Minn., in November and December, 1944.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As we saw in the <a href="/meteorological-instruments.html">Instruments Thread</a>, 
the flight instrumentation was still being developed at the time of the flights 
(1944). 
So, a limited set was available for this test. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>APPARATUS AND METHOD  </p>
<p>Air temperature and free water concentration were measured 
essentially by the same methods discussed by Hardy in reference 1. <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Drop sizes were measured by use of a cylinder
which
was covered with blueprint
paper and extended for a few
seconds into the air stream with its axis normal to the
direction of motion.
A 4 inch-diameter cylinder was chosen
since it can be used to measure drop diameters
from 8 to 35
microns at speeds from 120 to 200 miles per hour.
The blueprint
paper was exposed to light
just prior to use to make it  sensitive to small amounts of moisture
drops on the cylinder caused wetting of a strip
along the wind-ward side which was identified
by a change of color of the blueprint paper.
According to the theory of the movement of drops around a cylinder
as developed by Glauert (reference 21) <sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
the width of the area of impingement of drops is a function
of the drop size, the airspeed, and the diameter of the cylinder.
Data from Glauert's paper, corrected for deviations from
Stokes' law, were used to draw a set of curves which give the
drop diameter directly from the width
of the area of impingement and the airspeed.
These curves determine the diameter with an accuracy
of about +/-2 percent; however, it must be kept
in mind that these results contain any errors
that may be present in Glauert's
data. This method gives only the size of the largest
drops that are present in sufficient quantity to
affect the blueprint paper and tells nothing directly
about the size distribution.</p>
<p>The quantity
used in this report
to represent
drop size is
the mass of one drop times 10a.
This quantity,
which is
designated
W100, represents
the liquid
water concentration
in grams per cubic meter of a cloud having 100 such drops per
cubic centimeter.
If the drops are all the same size,
the
number of drops per cubic
centimeter is obtained
by dividing
the measured liquid
water by W100.
If the size distribution
is not uniform,
the calculated
number of drops will
be too
small.</p>
<p>METEOROLOGICAL DISCUSSION  </p>
<p>Since the moist layer is characterized by nearly complete adiabatic mixing,
it follows that the liquid water concentration
at any point in the cloud may be calculated
by considering an air parcel lifted adiabatically from the condensation level.
The free water is found by taking the change in saturation
mixing ratio,
which represents the amount of condensed water in grams per kilogram
of dry air and can be read from a pseudoadiabatic chart,
and multiplying it by the number of kilograms
of dry air per-cubic meter of saturated air to obtain 
the liquid water concentration in grams per cubic meter.
The results of such calculations when the concentration
(948 ft pressure altitude) pressure is taken as 980 millibars
are presented in figure 1. A similar
chart (fig.2) was prepared for a condensation pressure of 850 millibars
(4,780 ft, pressure altitude).
The two charts give the same values for liquid water concentration
to within 0.1 gram per cubic meter for all values of condensation
temperature below freezing and cloud thickness less than 1000 feet.
This shows that the actual elevation of the cloud base, or condensation
level, is of little importance and the significant factors
are the temperature at the cloud base and the height above
the cloud base.</p>

<p>Results and Discussion  </p>
<p>Representative temperature, dew-point, liquid water,
and drop-size data as obtained during four flights
through non-cyclonic stratus clouds are presented in figure 3. 
The values of W100 [largest drop size] obtained from individual
observations have been plotted and are represented by a faired curve.
Also presented in figure 3 are the droplet diameters in microns and values
of N, both of which have been computed from the faired
curve of W100 and the average drop diameter as calculated on the
assumption that the value of N measured at the top of the
cloud is the true value for the entire cloud layer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since noncyclonic stratus clouds are formed within
the surface turbulence layer, the thickness of this layer
sets an upper limit to the thickness of the cloud layer.
The highest stratus top encountered was at an altitude
of 5300 feet which was about 4,500 feet above the ground. 
It is believed that this is about the upper limit of the height
of the tops of clouds of this type.
The maximum thickness
observed was 2900 feet.
There is much observational evidence to support the
view that very low bases are seldom encountered in stratus
when the tops are relatively high.
It seems reasonable, then, to assume a
case with a top 4,500 feet above the ground and a layer 3000 feet 
thick is representing a good approximation to the most
unfavorable condition likely to be met.
Figure 4 shows the relation between liquid water concentration
and temperature at the top of a 3000-foot layer.
This shows a water content of 1.5 grams per cubic meter at 32 F,
which is the highest that is likely to occur at freezing temperatures.
It should be noted that the formation of snow is much more likely
at temperatures below 15 F, making the existence of thick water
clouds less likely at these temperatures.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Observations made in noncyclonic winter stratus clouds indicate that if snow is not falling,
the liquid water concentration can be approximately determined from the temperature
of the base and the thickness of the layer by assuming moist-adiabatic lapse rate and constant
total water content within the cloud.<br>
The observations of drop size are not inconsistent with
the theory that the number of drops per unit volume is constant throughout
the layer and the size distribution is more uniform
in the top than near the base.<br>
The effect of snowfall is a progressive depletion of liquid water starting
at the cloud base and continuing until only a thin layer of liquid
water remains on the top of the cloud.<br>
Calculations based on reasonable assumptions concerning
maximum cloud thickness show that the liquid
water concentration in noncyclonic stratus clouds is not likely
to exceed 1.5 grams per cubic meter at temperatures below freezing.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1.5 grams per cubic meter limit for stratus clouds is high compared to later data. </p>
