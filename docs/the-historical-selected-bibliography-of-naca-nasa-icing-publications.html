</blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A "Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications" identified 132 publications in 16 categories.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Publications</h3>
<p>This title was published twice. </p>
<p>The first was in 1969 in the "Aircraft Ice Protection Report of Symposium" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> as 
"Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Unclassified Icing Publications".
It was not credited, but immediately followed a paper by Vernon Gray.</p>
<p>The second publication was in 1981 in NASA-TM-81651 <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> . 
NASA-TM-81651 includes a reprint of Uwe von Glahn's "The Icing Problem: Current Status of NACA Techniques and Research" 
from 1955<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
That is followed by "Selected Bibliography of NACA-NASA Icing Publications", which is again not credited,
but the "Foreword" attributes it to Uwe von Glahn. 
The second publication includes the abstracts of all 132 publications.</p>
<p>The bibliographic lists are substantially similar in the two publications. 
Minor differences include different numberings, and some references are updated, such as 
"Summary of Statistical Icing Cloud Data Measured Over United States and North Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Ocean During Routine Aircraft Operations" 
was updated from "NASA Memo CCE-169" to "NASA Memo 1-19-59E".</p>
<h3>Requests for data</h3>
<p>In the "Foreword" of <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, Jack Reimann writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1978 Aircraft Icing Workshop the recommendation was
made that before attacking what appeared to be a new icing problem
we should study the icing work of the 1940's and 50's. The documents 
of that period were so old, however, that they were not
listed in the modern computerized library search systems, and some
of these documents were out of print. Fortunately, U. H. von Glahn
had prepared a selected bibliography of the NACA-NASA publications
in aircraft icing. This bibliolraphy was furnished to those who
requested information about the NACA works. But some of the 
citations in the bibliography were those that were out of print.</p>
<p>In 1979, both the AGARD Working Group (WG-09) on Rotorcraft 
Icing and the Helicopter Icing Panel SAE AC-9 Committee urged NASA 
to reissue the publications cited in von Glahn's bibliography. 
Concurrently, industry and other government organizations requested
that these reports be reissued. The present report was prepared in 
response to those requests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the requests from expert groups for 30+ year-old NACA icing data.</p>
<p>Also note <em>"The documents were so old, however, that they were not listed in the modern computerized library search systems, and some of these documents were out of print."</em>
Modern online searches, such as scholar.google.com, commonly miss many NACA citations. 
Most of the NACA publications are available only as image scans, and some of them of poor quality, 
from which the text is difficult extract accurately. </p>
<p>Ironically, NASA-TM-81651 <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> is currently "not listed in the modern computerized library search systems", 
as it is not in the NTRS <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> (it can be found with other online searches). 
The quality of the online version found is not good, so the text was not accurately parsed by computer 
(numerous manual corrections of scanned text were required to produce the listings below).  </p>
<h3>Publications not in the NTRS</h3>
<p>While most of the NACA publications are available at the NTRS <sup id="fnref2:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, some are not. The publications that I could not find copies of on the NTRS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two references to NASA-TM-X-54700, which purportedly documents the “Compilation of the Paper Presented at NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation".  However, the citation NASA-TM-X-54700 appears to be an error, as on the ntrs it is listed as “Space radiation- a compilation and discussion”. The “Compilation of the Paper Presented at NACA Conference on Some Problems of Aircraft Operation" is available as a print book.  <ul>
